22. An isotope of neptunium has a half life of 65 minutes. If the decay of Np-240 is modeled by the differential equation dy/dt = -ky, where t is measured in minutes, what is the decay constant k?

65 min = ln(2) / k
ln(2) / 65 min = k
k = 0.01066


24. A colony of bacteria is grown under ideal conditions in a laboratory so that the population increases exponentially with time. At the end of 3 hours there are 10,000 bacteria. At the end of 5 hours there are 40,000 bacteria. How many bacteria were present initially?

10k = y₀e^(k(3))

40k = y₀e^(k(5))


27. y = y₀e^(kt); (0, 2), (2, 5)


28. y = y₀e^(kt); (-3, 3), (0, 1.1)


31. Suppose that a cup of soup cooled fro 90°C to 60°C in 10 min in a room whose temperature was 20°C. Use Newton's law of cooling to answer the following questions.

a. How much longer would it take the soup to cool to 35°C?

b. Instead of being left to stand in the room, the cup of 90°C soup is put into a freezer whose temperature is -15°C. How long will it take the soup to cool from 90°C to 35°C?


32. The temperature of an ingot of silver is 60°C above room temperature right now. Twenty minutes ago, it was 70°C above room temperature. How far above room temperature will the silver be:

a. 15 minutes from now

b. 2 hours from now

c. When will the silver be 10°C above room temperature?
