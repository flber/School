3. trace the theological history of the term conscience
In the old testament it was called "heart", in the new testament Paul wrote how it guides in making moral decisions, judges the self, and provides a source of moral direction, medieval theologians debated it and thought that it was purely logical, Vatican II argued for a more holistic view, and current thinking is of it as a tool of moral reasoning.

4. summarize the most important points in our contemporary understanding of conscience among roman catholic theologians
- seeks moral truth from available sources
- a practical implementation of moral values
- analysis and reflection necessary to teach conscience

5. what is the relationship between moral choice and moral character, and which comes first
Moral choice is your behaviour, and what choices you make when faced with moral decisions. Moral character is a product of your moral choices, and is in essence who you morally are. If you make bad moral choices your moral character is bad, and as such moral choice comes before moral character.

6. what is the significance of conscience formation
The formation of one's conscience is the process by which one learns how to make moral decisions. It is based on a generation and absorbtion of moral values to form one's own idea of morality. There are also biological aspects

7. how can conscience be both supremely personal and necessarily communitarian
While conscience is clearly a personal affair - it is by necessity based on deeply personal values - it is also influenced by the community one exists in, because no one exists independent of a social influences.
