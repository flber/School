Science And Spirituality Powerpoint

1. Type out the statement that stood out for you and why/how So?
"Eventually, human beings defined science as an enterprise with specific guidelines for conducting it. Conclusions and reasoning must be based on evidence."This stood out to me because it quite concisely gets at the core principle of the scientific method: reproducibility.

2. How can religion and science coexist in society?
I think religion is adaptable enough to offer interpretations which work better with modern science, and is inherently impossible to prove one way or another. Though that means that its principles are often at odds with those of science, it allows a sort of truce between each argument with the knowledge that there's no way to prove one or the other.

3. What does each field offer to us?
I think religion is primarily useful as a social binder; a way for people to come together with common beliefs and values. Science, on the other hand, is more useful as a means of advancing society.
