Effect of temp on velocity distribution
	- as the temperature increases, range of velocities becomes larger
	
Effusion and Diffusion
	- Diffusion: describes the mixing of gases
		- rate of diffusion is the rate of mixing of gases
		- Graham's law of effusion
			- relative rates of effusion of two gases at the same T and P are given by the inverse ration of the square roots of the masses of the gas particles:
				┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
				│ RoE for gas 1 / RoE for gas 2 = sqrt(M_2) / sqrt(M_1) │
				└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
			- Graham's law is derived from the kinetic molecular model for gas velocities
	- Effusion: describes the passage of a gas through a tiny orifice into an evacuated chamber
		- rate of effusion measures the speed at which the gas is transferred into the chamber
			- inversely proportional to the square root of the mass of the gas particles
		- diffusion is roughly based on mass (complicated equation)

Ideal Gas Behavior
	- exhibited by real gases under certain conditions of:
		- low pressure
		- high temperature

van der Waals Equation
	- Actual volume of a given gas molecule can be calculated with:
		┌────────┐
		│ V - nb │
		└────────┘
		- V: volume of the container
		- nb: correction factor for the volume of the molecules
			- n: number of moles
			- b: empirical constant
	- ideal gas equation can be modified as follows:
		┌───────────────────────┐
		│ P' = (nRT) / (V - nb) │
		└───────────────────────┘
	- Size of the correction factor depends on the concentration of gas molecules
		- higher the concentration, the more likely that the particles will attract each other
			- causes the particles to hit the very slightly less often
		┌───────────────────────┐
		│ P_obs = P' - a(n/V)^2 │
		└───────────────────────┘
			- a: proportionality constant whose value can be determined by observing the actual behavior of the gas
	- Final van der Waals equation
		┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
		│ [P_obs + a(n/V)^2] * (V - nb) = nRT │
		└─────────────────────────────────────┘
			- values of a and b vary until the best fit for the observed pressure is obtained

## Ch 5.9

Behavior of Real Gases
	- for a real gas, the actual observer pressure is lower than the pressure expected for an ideal gas
		- caused due to intermolecular attractions that occur in real gases, which increase in the following order
			H_2 < N_2 < CH_4 < CO_2
