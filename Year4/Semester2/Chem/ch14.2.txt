Ch 14.2 # 50, 57, 68, 69, 70, 82


50. Calculate [H^+] and [OH^-] for each solution at 25Â°C. Identify each solution as neutral, acidic, or basic.

a. pH = 7.40 (the normal pH of blood)
[H^+] = 3.98 x 10^-8
[OH^-] = 2.51 x 10^-7
acidic

b. pH = 15.3
[H^+] = 5.01 x 10^-16
[OH^-] = 20.0
basic

c. pH = -1.0
[H^+] = 1.0 x 10^-1
[OH^-] = 1.0 x 10^-13
acidic

d. pH = 3.20
[H^+] = 6.31 x 10^-4
[OH^-] = 1.58 x 10^-11
acidic

e. pOH = 5.0
[H^+] = 1.0x 10^-9
[OH^-] = 1.0 x 10^-5
basic

f. pOH = 9.60
[H^+] = 3.98 x 10^-5
[OH^-] = 2.51 x 1-^-10
acidic
