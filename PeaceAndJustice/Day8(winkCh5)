--[[Welcome back everyone!!

Today we will be reading Wink, chapter 5 and answering some questions about what we read. This reading begins our final unit, “Jesus’ Third Way”/creative non-violence, in which we will be studying different people & movements that have used non-violence to “fight” injustice and oppression.

Begin by accessing Wink 5 in the Wink folder (you may also use your text if you have it at home). Read half of the chapter thoughtfully and you should be able to answer the 3 questions below (on a Word/Google Doc) & Schoology submit/”dropbox. Be sure to do your OWN WORK!!
