Physics practice problems

1. A grasshopper can accelerate at 4000. m/s^2 over a distance of 2.0 mm

a. What is it's velocity after accecleration
v^2 = v^2_0 + 2a(x - x_0)
v^2 = 2 4000. m/s^2 (0.0020 m)
v^2 = 16 m^s/s^2
v = 4.0 m/s

b. How long does it take to accelerate
v = v_0 + at
4.0 m/s = 4000. m/s^2 t^2
0.0010 s = t^2
0.0010 s = t

c. How high could it jump
v^2 = v^2_0 + 2a(x - x_0)
0 = 4.0 m/s + 2 (-9.8 m/s^2) x
-4.0 m/s = -19.6 m/s^2 x
