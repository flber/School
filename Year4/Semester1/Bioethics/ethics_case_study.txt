Group 5: "Cancer: A Failure to Communicate"
Malcolm Mackey, Chase Lee, and Ben Hammond

Main points:
- Tabrizi, a 69 year old immigrant from Iran, is brought into hospital after severe symptoms
- He doesn't speak English, but does speak Farsi
- His son intermittently acts as a translator for his father as he gets tests done, but his Mr. Tabrizi is reluctant to give detailed health information
- Tabrizi is also very reluctant to eat food given to him, and it is eventually explained that as a devout Muslim he's afraid there may be pork in the food
- A nurse is relatively curt with him about this, but says she'll see what she can do
- Eventually the doctor tells Tabrizi's son that his father has extensive lung cancer, and that he can either have chemotherapy or radiation treatment
- Tabrizi's son tells his father that he must do two things, eat well and get more rest, and that he could also take medicine
- When Tabrizi asks what the medicine would involve, the doctor responds and the son gives the outline of the doctor's statement
- Tabrizi refuses the treatment, saying it would compromise his relationships and put a burden on his wife

What could/should the doctor/hospital have done differently in order to handle this case in a more helpful and culturally competent manner?
They could have assured him that the food wouldn't have pork in it, as well as getting an actual translator.
