Chem Notes


chemical equilibrium:

- reactants or products can be favored
- visible changes cannot be detected in reactions at equilibrium
	- equilibrium is not static, but equally dynamic

law of mass action:
k = [p]^c_p / [r]^c_r
(if k is > 1 is favors products)

equilibrium position: 
	- refers to each set of equilibrium concentrations
equilibrium constant:
	- one constant for a particular system at a particular temperature

heterogeneous equilibria:
(pure) solids and liquids don't affect the law of mass action, and should not be included in the equilibrium constant equation
