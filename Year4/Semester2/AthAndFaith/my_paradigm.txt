What's Your Paradigm?

1. What is the paradigm? And what do you believe has influenced it?
I don't think there needs to be a god, but I can't prove that there isn't one. I think this has been heavily influenced by my upbringing in a scientific household, as well as my general outlook on life. 

2. Do you still believe it to be true? Why or why not?
I do, primarily because nothing has yet convinced me otherwise.

3. What do you believe can support it and why?
I don't think that there is anything that exactly supports it, but there also isn't anything that disproves it.

4. What do you believe can negate it and why? 
Not really, unless definitive proof is found one way or the other regarding god's existence.

5. Now what would be a paradigm you would like to question someone else about in this area and why? (Discussion for class)
I would like to hear from someone who strongly believes that there is no god, because I find any sort of universally applied opinion to be interesting.
