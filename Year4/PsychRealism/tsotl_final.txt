In Thomas Harris' "The Silence of the Lambs", Clarice Starling's behaviour is highly reflective of Adler's theories of psychoanalysis, from her responses to trauma and stress to her gravitation toward Adler's ideas of social interest.
When faced with old traumas and new pressures, Starling consistently relies on behaviours matching those of Adler's concept of the safeguarding tactic of idealization as well as his idea of fictional finalism.
