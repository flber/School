Consistent life ethic

- Historically many voices on this issue:
	- Eileen Egan: cannot protect some life and not others
	- Humberto Sousa: We must support every man's continuing right to live
	- Some early feminists were pro life

- Cardinal Joesph Bernardin
	- All human life from conception to natural death is sacred and valuable, which must be protected. This is from abortion, death penalty, euthanasia, war, murder...
	- Assisted nutrition and hydration is always an obligation for those who are suffering and have end of life issues but there are three questions to ask:
		- Are they working
		- is it for proper finality
		- excessive burden

- Slippery Slope:
	- how to allow for exceptions and maintain consistency
	- when is the unborn more or less human
	- how to judge
	- use of euthanasia
	- certain people having priority over others

- Is there a difference between humans and personhood
	- no

- Church's view:
	- person if you are human
	- only humans are made in god's image
	- body belongs to god
	- sanctity and dignity of human body is of upmost value
	- part of the whole

- Joseph Fletcher
	- degrees of personhood
	- I.Q. is measure of personhood
	- self awareness, self control, sense of time, sense of futility, sense of past and present

- Core to Genesis
	- honor others
	- must still respect the earth
	- support the marginalized

- Questions
	- What are the advantage of the CLE
		Simplicity and no room for interpretation.
	- What are the challenges of the CLE
		Simplicity and no room for interpretation, and a lack of emphasis on the situation.
	- What are your thought on Fletcher's view
		Idiotic to use I.Q. scale but gradient theory itself is useful.
	- Slippery slope
		A reasonable worry, but CLE is too simplistic
