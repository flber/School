Physics Notes

Ch 4

F_n = mg cos(theta)
F_p = mg sin(theta)

mg sin(theta) = μmg cos(theta)
sin(theta) = μ cos(theta)
μ = tan(theta)
theta = tan^-1(μ)


Ch 5

Uniform circular motion: motion in a circle of constant radius at a constant speed

centripetal acceleration points toward the center of the circle:
a_r = v^2 / r
