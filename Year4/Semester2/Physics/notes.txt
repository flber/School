Physics Notes

Momentum:
p = mv
F(net) = Δp / Δt

m_av_a + m_bv_b = m_av'_a + m_bv'_b

Impulse = FΔt

If momentum and energy are conserver, the collision is elastic. If energy is not conserved, the collision is inelastic. 

For elastic collisions:
v_a + v_a' = v_b' + v_b

conversion of horizontal velocity to upward movement
h = v^2 / 2g

Momentum is conserved in two dimensions
