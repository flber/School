Short Journal Question

During the last 10 months we have been living through a global pandemic which has challenged EACH of us in every way. Has this challenged your belief in God in any way? How? If not, explain. If you do not believe in God, how does this impact your stance? If you believe in God, how does this impact your stance?

I do not believe that god exists, and the past 10 months haven't really impacted my stance on that issue. This is mostly due to the fact that while I don't *think* that god exists, I recognize that it's impossible to prove that one way or the other. With that in mind, I believe that is less likely that god exists, simply because I see no reason why a god would have to exist. I also think that if a god did exist, it would be the greatest existential threat humanity has ever experienced. In that regard I think Norse mythology has the right idea; the Norse gods were seen as incredibly flawed but powerful beings whose actions resulted in great devastation and creation. Given all that happens in our universe (especially within the past 10 months as was pointed out), I think that the existence of a god is more of a cause for concern than for worship.
