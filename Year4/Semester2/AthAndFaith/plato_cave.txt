Plato's Allegory of the Cave

1. I think point of Plato's analogy of the cave was similar to trying to describe higher dimensions. It's very difficult to simply describe what a higher dimension looks like, but it's far easier to get a sense of the difference by thinking about a change from two dimensions to three, both concepts we as humans are familiar with. Similarly, Plato uses the idea of a cave of shadows as a "lower" dimension, which is then revealed to have a "higher" dimension (our real world) to the example philosopher. This allows the reader to at least imagine that our world is the shadow world, and that there is yet another, higher plane of understanding.

2. This can be related to faith in several ways. In one interpretation, the real world could be describes as faith; a higher level of understanding. However, you could also argue that religion is the shadow world, a ruse to keep people entertained. The real world would then be a higher level of understanding: philosophy or science.

3. The sun acts as the obvious indicator of the reality of the new world the person discovers. It also acts as an opposite to the shadows which comprise the fake world.

4. Plato pities the other enslaved men because they do not know the true nature of their existence.

5. The enslaved men would try and kill anyone who tried to release them because it is far easier to stay in ignorance than it is to discover the truth of reality.

6. This analogy says that knowledge is incredibly important to the understanding of the reality one lives in.

7. One example of open knowledge which I find amazing is the sheer volume of open source software and resources. It is incredibly easy to see what other people are working on and how they're doing it, making the entry bar to computer science lower than it has ever been.
