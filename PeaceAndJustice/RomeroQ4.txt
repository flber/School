Why didnâ€™t the soldiers shoot Romero (or anyone else) when they
re-claimed the church at Aguilares? Explain in one full paragraph
all the key factors/reasons that this was merely a close call and not
an assassination/bloodbath.

I think that the primary reason that the soldiers didn't open fire is because of their confrontation with their own humanity. When they were forced to confront the reality of what shooting people would mean, they found themselves unable to do it. Additionally, at least one of the soldiers seemed to be afraid of the mass of people, led by Romero. So not only were the soldiers afraid of their personal repercusions to killing the mass of people, but they were also likely afraid of the mass itself. There is also an obvious religious element to this, because the mass of people wasn't just led by some random person that the soldiers could have rationalized killing, but by Romero, the archbishop, an important religious figure. This combination of things, from the personal issues the soldiers likely had, the fear of a large mass of dedicated people, and respect for a prominent religious figure all likely played key roles in the soldiers' reticence to fire upon the people.
