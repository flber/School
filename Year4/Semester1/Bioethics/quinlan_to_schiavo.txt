Quinlan to Schiavo p 303-306

- "good medical ethics begins not with the discipline of ethics but with good clinical medicine"
- minimally conscious states are separate conditions
- patients may go between states
- suffering requires consciousness
- most serious brain injuries begin with coma, is not usually permanent (changes to other state)
- brain death is irreversible loss of function of the brain
	- cortex: motor & cognitive function
	- midbrain: integrates higher and lower functions
	- brain stem: sleep-wake cycles and breathing
	- brain death is legal death in all 50 states (NJ and NY have exceptions based on orthodox Jewish cardiorespiratory standard)
	- no legal or moral obligation to maintain treatment for brain-dead patients
- vegetative state: eyes-opened unconsciousness
	- upper and midbrain are not integrated with brain stem
	- patients may have variety of non-purposeful movements
	- no reproducible responses to stimuli
	- study found no returns to consciousness in patients with anoxic injuries for over 2 years
	- younger patients typically survive for longer in vegetative states
- locked in state: consciousness is preserved but the patient is paralyzed
- minimally conscious state
	- sleep/wake cycle is maintained
	- arousal levels vary
	- reproducible but inconsistent evidence of perception, communication, and motor activity
	- visual tracking is inconsistent
	- communication is either nonexistent or inconsistent
	- though represents less severe brain malfunction than vegetative, it can induce greater suffering
- ethics belongs to the community

- Terri Schiavo
	- cardiac arrest in 1990, entered vegetative state
	- husband appointed legal guardian
	- felt she would not want to be kept on life support
	- parents thought she should be kept on life support
	- husband filed to have removed from life support in 1998
	- in 2000 the court sided with the husband, parents appealed
	- in 2001-2003 was taken on and off ANH
	- in 2003 the senate passed law allowing the Governor to restore feeding tube
	- 2004 supreme court decision struck down senate law citing separation of powers
	- in 2005 feeding tube was removed and she died
- 2004 Pope John Paul said that it is a responsibility to keep patients on ANH
	- not all priests agreed
	- argument against: prolonging natural death
- Autonomy
	- lost in vegetative states and brain death
		- can be maintained through living will
	- surrogates can take over autonomy
- Beneficence and nonmaleficence
	- vegetative state patients can't feel pain
	- is it ethical to sustain someone who is not going to get better


Questions

1. What top 3 things should a person consider when ending life support for patient in vegetative state?
Whether or not it is persistent, potential quality of life after return from temporary vegetative state, and resources required to maintain the life support

2. How much should finances be considered in this decision?
It shouldn't outweigh a possible recovery, but given a persistent vegetative state it becomes part of the argument for removal of life support

3. Who should be offered life support?
Anyone who needs it?
