Brittany Maynard - Death With Dignity

1. What was Brittany's diagnosis and age?

She had brain cancer at age 29.

2. What was her main message in this video?

Her main message was that euthanasia should be be made legal in California.

3. What reasons did she give for NOT wanting to have palliative or hospice care? Is this reasonable, why or why not?

She mainly wanted to be with her family when she died, which seems reasonable to me.

4. How is this action DIFFERENT than "allowing someone to die naturally" or "pulling the plug?"

While it is literally a more direct action, I don't think it is practically different than either of other two.

5. (Imagine that this was your sister or cousin...) Do you agree with this decision? Why or why not?

I think it's ultimately up to them.

6. What could be a concern in this becoming legal?

It could devalue the health care industry, and lower-income families may feel forced to utilize euthanasia instead of paying incredibly expensive medical fees.
