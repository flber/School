## Matrix Notes

### Scene 1: Trinity and the Agents

1.  How do the camera angles, lighting, sound effects add to the dystopian feeling of the city?

2.  Describe the three agents (costumes, demeanor, dialogue). Why do you think they are depicted this way?
 
### Scene 2: Neo, Trinity, and Bar Scene

1. Track references to Alice in Wonderland. Why allude to that story?

2. “My own personal Jesus Christ.” Track religious allusions in the film.
 
### Scene 3: Neo at the Office, Agent Interrogation, and Escape

1. Neo receives (a literal) call to adventure. Attempts to scale the building/scaffolding. At what point does he “refuse” the call? Can you track other elements of the Hero’s Journey in this film? What’s limiting about the monomyth in this storyline?

2.  How does Neo become a symbol of resistance? Close read the scene in the interrogation room.

3. Who is Morpheus? What is the significance of his name in relation to his role in the film?

4. Track the ideas of fate and free will throughout the film. What is Neo’s take on fate? Does it change? How?

5. Interpret various symbols in the scene: fractured mirror, Neo reflected in Morpheus’ glasses, quicksilver…

6. How do the machines throughout the scene look like familiar objects/creatures?
 
### Scene 4: The Nebuchadnezzar, Training and “The Desert of the Real”

1. What is the matrix? See footnote “brain in a vat.” Track the history of AI takeover.

2. Note/comment on the warped agricultural imagery.

3. They “liquefied the dead so they could be fed intravenously to the living.” Thoughts?

4. Continue to track religious allusions and patterns.
 
### Scene 5: Cypher’s Betrayal

1. What’s Cypher’s rationale? Would you be willing to make a similar choice given the circumstances?

2. Mouse pontificates, “to deny our own impulses is to deny the very thing that makes us human.” Do you agree or disagree?
 
### Scene 6: Going to see the Oracle, Know Thyself, Trap

1. Track the Greek allusions in this scene. Note their significance.

2. Spoon bending. What “truth” does Neo learn?

3. What is significant about the broken vase? (free will/determinism)

4. What is the Oracle’s prophecy for Neo? 
 
### Scene 7: Interrogation of Morpheus, The Rescue, and Resurrection

1. According to Agent Smith, how was the first matrix designed? Why did humans reject it? What do you think the larger commentary is here? Can you connect this idea to any of the stories we read this semester?

2. What does Smith compare humans to? Is this an apt comparison? What scenes in the film lend themselves to ecocriticism?
He compares us to a virus, which I think is pretty apt. 

3. Consider the rescue scene. Almost twenty years later, do we find anything problematic with it?
Definitely a case of the white saviour motif.

4. Track the Western imagery in the subway station. Why draw on this film tradition?
The "tumbleweed", countless face offs, and they even occasionally have their hands at their sides, as if about to draw revolvers. The use of this imagery grounds the otherwise fantastical science fiction story with recognizable and approachable shots and characters.

5. Comment on the love story.
It seems a bit unnecessary really.
