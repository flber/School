1. What are the four persuasive arguments to support atheism? Describe Each.
"The problem of pain", that if god exists he cannot be good, and if he is good than he must not be god.
"Occam's razor", there's no reason for a god to exist, and thus the most reasonable conclusion is that there is not a god.
"The emptiness of god", the idea of god is connected to an unvalidated entity.
"Negative consequences of faith", faith can take away independence and autonomy.

2. What are the two basic evils?
The two basic evils are physical evil and moral evil.

3. What is said about evolution and God’s limited power? What does Carl Sagan say?
The reason evolution calls god's power into question is to do with efficiency: why limit your creation to a slow development over millions of years if you can do it in days, or in an instant? Carl Sagan argued that evolution doesn't support the idea of an efficient designer, thinking about all of the inefficiency in our reality.

4. What was said about evil if there is no God?
If there is no god, no ultimate arbitrator, then evil does not exist, in the sense that there is no objective basis to right or wrong.

5. The author stated that atheism is a “calculated act of faith.” Do you agree or disagree? Explain briefly.
I agree, but i think that it is more defensible. Of course, it is undermined by its own arguments; if nothing matters against the vast expanse of time and space then why couldn't there be a god?

6. What is said about suffering if there is no God?
If god does not exist, then suffering loses all meaning, logic, and purpose.

7. What are the negative consequences of belief?
Everything from the Inquisition to the crusades to the holocaust can be linked back to religion, which begs the question how such belief could possibly be worth the suffering it has caused.

8. What does Jean Paul Sartre say? Pascal say? What is your opinion of each quote?
I couldn't find these quotes.
