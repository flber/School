4. A 1200 N crate rests on the floor. How much work is required to move it at a constant speed a) 5.0 m along the floor against a friction force of 230 N, and b) 5.0 m vertically?

a. 1150 J
b. 6000 J


8. A lever such as that shown in fig 6-35 can be used to lift objects we might not otherwise be able to lift. Show that the ratio of output force, F_0, to input force, F_1, is related to the lengths l_1 and l_0 from the pivot by F_0 / F_1 = l_1 / l_0. Ignore friction and the mass of the lever, and assume the work output equals the work input.

W = F_0 * l_0
W = F_1 * l_1
F_0 * l_0 = F_1 * l_1
F_0 / F_1 = l_1 / l_0


10. A 380-kg piano slides 2.9 m down a 25° incline and is kept from accelerating by a man who is pushing back on it parallel to the incline (Fig. 6–36). Determine: a) the force exerted by the man, b) the work done on the piano by the man, c) the work done on the piano by the force of gravity, and d) the net work done on the piano. Ignore friction.

a. F = -mg sin(theta)
F = -380 * 9.8 sin(25°)
F = -1600 N

bcd. I'm not sure how to solve for work without a distance or velocity.


13. The force on a particle, acting along the x axis, varies as shown in Fig. 6–38. Determine the work done by this force to move the particle along the x axis: a) from to x = 0.0 to x = 10.0 m; b) from to x = 0.0 to x = 15.0 m

a. W_1 = 3 * 400 + 4 * 400
W_1 = 2800 J

b. W_2 = W_1 - (1.5 * 400 + 2 * 400)
W_2 = 1400


19. Two bullets are fired at the same time with the same kinetic energy. If one bullet has twice the mass of the other, which has the greater speed and by what factor? Which can do the most work?

The less massive bullet has the greater speed, by a factor of sqrt(2). They can both do the same amount of work.


25. A 265 kg load is lifted 18.0 m vertically with an acceleration a = 0.160 g by a single cable. Determine a) the tension in the cable; b) the net work done on the load; c) the work done by the cable on the load; d) the work done by gravity on the load; e) the final speed of the load assuming it started from rest.

a. F = ma
F = 265 kg * (9.8 m/s^2 * 0.160)
F = 265 kg * 1.568 m/s^2
F = 416 N

b. W = fd
W = 416 N * 18.0 m
W = 7479 J

d. 7479 J

d. -7479 J

e. v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(x - x_0)
v^2 = 2 * 1.568 m/s^2 * 18.0 m
v^2 = 56.45 m^2/s^2
v = 7.51 m/s


28. If it requires 6.0 J of work to stretch a particular string by 2.0 cm from its equilibrium length, how much more work will be required to stretch it an additional 4.0 cm?

6.0 J = k 0.02 m
k = 300

W = 300 * 0.06 m
W = 18 J

18 J - 6.0 J
12 J
