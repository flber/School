What is Bioethics: Genetic Modification

1. What is the issue?
Genetic modification (though in my opinion it's not actually an issue in and of itself, just a tool we can use)

2. What questions come up when discussion the issue?
What is genetic modification? How is it used now? What are some benefits of its uses? What are some downsides of its uses? Who primarily uses it, and why?

3. WHO plays a role in this decision and why?
I'm not sure what "decision" you're refering to. My response to the question "should we use genetic modification" is "everyone, but also only the people who use it". If you don't like genetic modification, then don't buy anything that uses something from anything genetically modified. However, unless laws are passed which prevent genetic modification (which I think would be hugely destructive, considering that projections estimate that by 2050 we'll need to be producing 70% more food just to keep up with population growth), it's still up to companies and even individuals to use genetic modification tools.

4. WHO has the final say in it and why?
Anyone who wants to use it, because you can order genetic material for use online.

5. Why is this a bioethical issue?
I don't think genetic modification is an issue on its own, just how we use it.

6. What should the patient need to know BEFORE making this decision?
There is no decision to use genetic modification in humans, so this is not an issue.

7. Is there certain aspects to CONSENT? Age? Awareness? Health?
Plants and micro-organisms can't give consent, so this isn't really an issue.

8. Does mental health of a person matter here? Why or why not?
Again, not used in humans.

9. What are some basic rights one must follow?
I'm not really sure what this question is asking in this context.
