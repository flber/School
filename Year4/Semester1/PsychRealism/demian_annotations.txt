Demian Annotations

-- Ch 1

"The realms of day and night, two different worlds coming from two opposite poles, mingled during this time"
- Good and bad, big theme to watch

"Straight lines and paths led into the future: there were duty and guilt, bad conscience and confession, forgiveness and good resolutions, love, reverence, wisdom and the words of the Bible"
- fate amidst these two themes, fate controlling good and bad

"everywhere this second vigorous world erupted and gave off its scent, everywhere, that is, except in our parents' rooms. And that was good. It was wonderful that peace and orderliness, quiet and a good conscience, forgiveness and love, ruled in this one realm, and it was 
wonderful that the rest existed, too"
- the "good" world, what he's brought up with

"Sometimes I was absolutely certain that my destiny was to become like mother and father, as clear-sighted and unspoiled, as orderly and superior as they. But this goal seemed far away and to reach it meant attending endless schools, studying, passing tests and examinations, and this way led past and through the other, darker realm"
- darker realm as omnipresent, the easier choice and the temptation

"the part of the story set among the evil and the lost was more appealing by far, and -- if I could have admitted it -- at times I didn't want the Prodigal Son to repent and be found again"
identification with the prodigal sone and with his time of sin (dark realm)

"Then followed harsh hours of gloomy regret and contrition, the painful moment when I begged forgiveness, to be followed again by beams of light, a quiet, thankful, undivided gladness"
- superficial disobedience and penance, temporal and without import

"I felt it would be useless to appeal to his sense of honor. He came from the other world: betrayal was no crime to him. I sensed this acutely. The people from the other world were not like us in these matters"
- very obvious dividing between good and bad (rich and poor)

"all of it was lost to me now, all of it belonged to the clear, well-lighted world of my father and mother, and I, guilty and deeply engulfed in an alien world, was entangled in adventures and sin, threatened by an enemy, -- by dangers, fear, and shame"
- artificial seperation of the two worlds and those who reside in them (either or, not both)

"I was haunted by misfortune, it was reaching out toward me so that not even my mother could protect me, since she was not even allowed to know. Whether my crime was stealing or lying -- (hadn't I sworn a false oath by God and everything that was sacred?) -- was immaterial. My sin was not specifically this or that but consisted of having shaken hands with the devil"
- sin for sin's sake? sort of weird preoccupation with the *idea* of sin

"it was no use. I knew I wouldn't do it. I knew I now had a secret, a sin which I would have to expiate alone. Perhaps I stood at the parting of the ways, perhaps I would now belong among the wicked forever, share their secrets, depend on them, obey them, have to become one of their kind"
- idea of fate, one choice effects the future

"A strange new feeling overcame me at this point, a feeling that stung pleasurably: I felt superior to my father! Momentarily I felt a certain loathing for his ignorance. His upbraiding me for muddy boots seemed pitiful. "If you only knew" crossed my mind as I stood there like a criminal being cross-examined for a stolen loaf of bread when the actual crime was murder"
- sort of funny, odd superiority through the idea of sin

"It was the first rent in the holy image of my father, it was the first fissure in the columns that had upheld my childhood, which every individual must destroy before he can become himself"
- process of individuation, finding one's own path without mentors, the destruction of innocence

"one cannot apologize for something fundamental, and a child feels and knows this as well and as deeply as any sage"
- inability to apologize for one's own nature, good or bad?

"God's grace was with all of them, but it was no longer with me. Cold and deeply exhausted, I had left them"
- divided and judgemental god, loneliness (step of individuation)

"breaking it hurt -- only now had I really committed a theft. Until then I had filched lumps of sugar or some fruit; this was more serious stealing, even though it was my own money I stole. I sensed how I was one step nearer Kromer and his world, how bit by bit everything was going downhill with me"
- sense of slipper slope, bad leads to more bad, but no sense of his own power (fatalism?)

"'Among men of honor you've got to do things right. I don't want to take anything away from you that isn't the right sum. You know that. Take your pennies back, there!'"
- irony, Kromer (while extorting Sinclair) talks about honor and doing the right thing

"There was not a single place, not a single game, no activity, no thought which this whistle did not penetrate, the whistle that made me his slave, that had become my fate"
- a whistle (dog whistle?) strips Sinclair of his freedom, his self is tied to that freedom

"Amid the ordered peace of our house I lived shyly, in agony, like a ghost; I took no part in the life of the others, rarely forgot myself for an hour at a time"
- his introspection is what binds him more than any person's opinions or actions


-- Ch 2

"I couldn't say that he made a favorable impression on me; on the contrary, I had something against him: he seemed too superior and detached, his manner too provocatively confident, and his eyes gave him an adult expression -- which children never like"
- dislike of supposed superiority, deeply ingrained in the human psyche

"'Oh, that's certainly true. The strong man slew a weaker one. It's doubtful whether it was really his brother, But it isn't important. Ultimately all men are brothers. So, a strong man slew a weaker one: perhaps it was a truly valiant act, perhaps it wasn't'"
- moral relativism, interestingly independent view of the story

"I had never before given as much thought to a biblical story or to any other story. And for a long time I had not forgotten Franz Kromer as completely; for hours, for a whole evening in fact. At home I read the story once more as written in the Bible"
- step in individuation, questioning of established ideals, he reads it for himself

"Yes, at that moment I, who was Cain and bore the mark, had imagined that this sign was not a mark of shame and that because of my evil and misfortune I stood higher than my father and the pious, the righteous"
- importance because of isolation of pariahs

"A stone had been dropped into the well, the well was my youthful soul. And for a very long time this matter of Cain, the fratricide, and the "mark" formed the point of departure for all my attempts at comprehension, my doubts and my criticism"
- new way of thinking for Sinclair, interesting metaphor of the well

"For years I have been unable to distinguish between what I experienced in these dreams and in real life. In any event, the bad relationship with Kromer continued and by no means came to an end after I had finally paid my debt out of any number of petty thefts"
- Honest admittance of the unreliability of the narration, heavily influenced by memory and emotion

"The adult who has learned to translate a part of his feelings into thoughts notices the absence of these thoughts in a child, and therefore comes to believe that the child lacks these experiences, too. Yet rarely in my life have I felt and suffered as deeply as at that time"
- difference between feelings and thoughts, thoughts as a more processed form of feelings

"I looked up helplessly at his face, which was as serious and intelligent as ever, and kind. Yet its detached severity lacked tenderness; impartiality or something similar was visible in it"
- Demian as the object of Sinclair's psyche

"'However, you realize, don't you, that your fear of him is all wrong? Such fear can destroy us completely. You've got to get rid of it, you've simply got to, if you want to turn into someone decent. You understand that, don't you?'"
- self control as primary force of individuation, any subversion of the ability for one to command oneself subverts the process of individuation

"'There's just one more thing I'd like to say to you since we've gotten so far -- you ought to get rid of this bastard! If there's no other way of doing it, kill him. It would impress and please me if you did! I'd even lend you a hand'"
- well that escalated quickly. Demian definitely as a Cain-esque figure

"He evaded all my questions, leaving me with the same uneasy feeling toward him I'd had before: a strange mixture of gratitude and awe, admiration and fear, sympathy and inward resistance"
- almost a father figure for Sinclair, acts as a protector

"I fled from the valley of sorrow, my horrible bondage to Kromer, with all the strength at the command of my injured soul: back to where I had been happy and content, back to the lost paradise that was opening up again now, back to the light, untroubled world of mother and father, my sisters, the smell of cleanliness, and the piety of Abel"
- immediately returns to the "good" side, ignores companionship of Demian

"He too -- though differently from Kromer -- was a tempter; he, too, was a link to the second, the evil world with which I no longer wanted to have anything to do. I did not want to sacrifice Abel to glorify Cain, not just now when I had once more become Abel"
- reticence to sacrifice comfort for self-discovery

"for, if one believed that Cain was right and Abel in the wrong, then it followed that God had made a mistake; in other words, the God of the Bible was not the right and only one, but a false God"
- yup


-- Ch 3

"But my interest centers on the steps that I took to reach myself. All the moments of calm, the islands of peace whose magic I felt, I leave behind in the enchanted distance. Nor do I ask to ever set foot there again"
- self discovery can only occur during times of hardship

"These impulses always came from the 'other world' and were accompanied by fear, constraint, and a bad conscience. They were always revolutionary and threatened the calm in which I would gladly have continued to live"
- chaos and strife lead to revolution in was of thinking, and uppend the status quo

"My conscious self lived within the familiar and sanctioned world, it denied the new world that dawned within me. Side by side with this I lived in a world of dreams, drives, and desires of a chthonic nature, across which my conscious self desperately built its fragile bridges, for the childhood world within me was falling apart"
- ego vs id, dual nature of humanity

"Perhaps he was handsome, perhaps I liked him, perhaps I also found him repulsive, I could not be sure of that either. All I saw was that he was different from us, he was like an animal or like a spirit or like a picture, he was different, unimaginably different from the rest of us"
- before just saw repulsion from difference, now that's paired with some attraction, shows shift in Sinclair's thinking

"despite all good intentions, my interest in religious matters was greatly diminished. What the pastor discussed lay far away in a very holy but unreal world of its own; these things were no doubt quite beautiful and precious, but they were by no means as timely and exciting as the new things I was thinking about"
- reality and the present vs abstract thought, the real world wins out

"Even though these tricks amused me, I began to notice gradually that my friend frequently played the same game with me. It would happen on my way to school that I would suddenly feel Demian walking not far behind me and when I turned around he was there in fact"
- Demian doesn't quite seem real, he's too convenient

"A person can neither think what he wants to nor can I make him think what I want to. However, one can study someone very closely and then one can often know almost exactly what he thinks or feels and then one can also anticipate what he will do the next moment"
- idea of fate, impossible to stray from one's path, now also the ide that you can manupilate that stream

"We have a wider scope, greater variety of choice, and wider interests than an animal. But we, too, are confined to a relatively narrow compass which we cannot break out of"
- illusion of free choice, choice within a narrow band of possibilities

"'Once again it's nothing but a priest's fairy tale, saccharine and dishonest, touched up with sentimentality and given a highly edifying background. If you had to pick a friend from between the two thieves or decide which of the two you had rather trust, you most certainly wouldn't select that sniveling convert'"
- I suppose that makes sense, honor in the ability to stick to ones morals

"'we ought to consider everything sacred, the entire world, not merely this artificially separated half! Thus alongside the divine service we should also have a service for the devil. I feel that would be right. Otherwise you must create for yourself a God that contains the devil too and in front of which you needn't close your eyes when the most natural things in the world take place'"
- uniting of the two worlds, interesting because it fixes some of the things which I think don't make sense with religion otherwise, dealing with the "evil" half of the world

"'Only the ideas that we actually live are of any value. You knew all along that your sanctioned world was only half the world and you tried to suppress the second half the same way the priests and teachers do. You won't succeed. No one succeeds in this once he has begun to think'"
- actions speak louder than words, some sense of fate, can't change path once started on

"It was not into the church that I was ready to be received but into something entirely different -- into an order of thought and personality that must exist somewhere on earth and whose representative or messenger I took to be my friend"
- very much mentor image, Demian as a sort of ambassador for Sinclair

"A disenchantment falsified and blunted my usual feelings and joys: the garden lacked fragrance, the woods held no attraction for me, the world stood around me like a clearance sale of last year's secondhand goods, insipid, all its charm gone"
- start of a theme of nature as an extension of the human psyche?


-- Ch 4

"I behaved with utter indifference to the world outside and for days on end voices within preoccupied me, inner streams, the forbidden dark streams that roared below the surface"
- New dichotomy, inner vs outer

"I fell in with this role, even exaggerated it, and grumbled myself into a self-isolation that must have appeared to outsiders like permanent and masculine contempt of the world, whereas, in truth, I often secretly succumbed to consuming fits of melancholy and despair"
- interesting early look at masculinity

"'There's something to walking with autumnal thoughts through the evening fog. One likes to compose poems at a time like that, I know. About moribund nature, of course, and one's lost youth, which resembles it. Heinrich Heine, for example'"
- this guy actually seems pretty chill, not sure what Sinclair's so nervous about...

"When he called me a damned clever little bastard, the words ran like sweet wine into my soul. The world glowed in new colors, thoughts gushed out of a hundred audacious springs. The fire of enthusiasm flared up within me"
- fun metaphors, perhaps shows lack of positive feedback in Sinclair's life?

"Something about it didn't sound right, and it tasted less appealing and more ordinary than love, I felt, was supposed to taste -- but at least: this was reality, this was life and adventure, and next to me sat someone who had experienced it, to whom it seemed normal"
- more dichotomies, ideals vs reality, what he wants to be true vs what is true

"everything, all of this -as I realized now -- had still been mine yesterday, a few hours ago, had waited for me; yet now, at this very hour, everything looked ravaged and damned, was mine no longer, rejected me, regarded me with disgust"
- return to the dichotomy between good and evil

"That's what I looked like, I, who came out of such pure gardens where everything was cleanliness, radiance, and tenderness, I, who had loved the music of Bach and beautiful poetry. With nausea and outrage I could still hear my life, drunk and unruly, sputtering out of me in idiotic laughter, in jerks and fits"
- fun metaphors and biblical imagery, idea of leaving that pure world

"Nonetheless, I felt wretched. I lived in an orgy of self-destruction and, while my friends regarded me as a leader and as a damned sharp and funny fellow, deep down inside me my soul grieved"
- the inner vs outer persona

"I was alone and was filled with intense longing for love, a hopeless longing, while, to judge by my talk, I should have been a hard-boiled sensualist. No one was more easily hurt, no one more bashful than I. And when I happened to see the young well-brought-up girls of the town walking in front of me, pretty and clean, innocent and graceful, they seemed like wonderful pure dreams, a thousand times too good for me"
- purity of youth, certainly putting them on pedestals, the object

"Everything seemed out of place: the presents and Christmas greetings, Gospel reading and the lit-up tree. The gingerbread smelled sweet; it exuded a host of memories which were even sweeter. The fragrance of the Christmas tree told of a world that no longer existed"
- not only a disconinuity with the holidays, but also with the religion that it represents

"Suddenly a new image had risen up before me, a lofty and cherished image. And no need, no urge was as deep or as fervent within me as the craving to worship and admire"
- an innate human desire to worship and look up to something? unique to Sinclair or true to humanity in general...

"But now I had something I loved and venerated, I had an ideal again, life was rich with intimations of mystery and a feeling of dawn that made me immune to all taunts. I had come home again to myself, even if only as the slave and servant of a cherished image"
- purpose for something else, not necessarily for himself, perhaps self destructive

"As I sat down in front of the completed painting, it had an odd effect on me. It resembled a kind of image of God or a holy mask, half male, half female, ageless, as purposeful as it was dreamy, as rigid as it was secretly alive. This face seemed to have a message for me, it belonged to me, it was asking something of me. It bore a resemblance to someone, yet I did not know whom"
- Demian?

"It was precisely at this time that I again began having many dreams, as I had always had as a child"
- return to the innocence of childhood

"Why had it taken me so long? It was Demian's face"
- obviously

"gradually I began to sense that this was neither Beatrice nor Demian but myself. Not that the picture resembled me -- I did not feel that it should -- but it was what determined my life, it was my inner self, my fate or my daemon"
- personification of fate, theme?

"'And then -- I read that once somewhere -- the life of a hedonist is the best preparation for becoming a mystic. People like St. Augustine are always the ones that become visionaries. He, too, was first a sensualist and man of the world'"
- vision as a function of inution and self-knowledge

"It was an accident that this transformation coincided with my parents' and teachers' wishes. This change did not bring me into the community of the others, did not make me closer to anyone, but actually made me even lonelier"
- Sinclair almost seems lonely for the sake of being lonely


-- Ch 5

"There could be no doubt about it, this was Demian's reply. No one else could know about my painting. He had grasped its meaning and was helping me interpret it. But how did all of this fit together? And -- this oppressed me most of all -- what did Abraxas signify?"
- Again, Demain seems oddly convenient, maybe figment of Sinclair's psyche

"this meant that we would either have to have a god who was also a devil or institute a cult of the devil alongside the cult of god. And now Abraxas was the god who was both god and devil"
- joining of the two worlds

"Love had ceased to be the dark animalistic drive I had experienced at first with fright, nor was it any longer the devout transfiguration I had offered to Beatrice. It was both, and yet much more. It was the image of an angel and Satan, man and woman in one flesh, man and beast, the highest good and the worst evil"
- final (?) and whole view of love, not just one thing but a myriad

"Only one thing was certain: the voice within me, the dream image. I felt the duty to follow this voice blindly wherever it might lead me. But it was difficult and each day I rebelled against it anew"
- Sinclair has a sense of his of fate, but rebells against it 

"I called it mother and knelt down in front of it in tears. I called it my beloved and had a premonition of its ripe all-fulfilling kiss. I called it devil and whore, vampire and murderer. It enticed me to the gentlest love-dreams and to devastating shamelessness, nothing was too good and precious, nothing was too wicked and low for it"
- all of these different facets of this image, facets of his fate

"And I longed desperately to really live for once, to give something of myself to the world, to enter into a relationship and battle with it. Sometimes when I ran through the streets in the evening, unable to return before midnight because I was so restless, I felt that now at this very moment I would have to meet my beloved"
- desire for love, but also maybe more generally desire for compansionship and end to the loneliness in his self-discovery

"And all this music said the same thing, all of it expressed what was in the musician's soul: longing, a most intimate atonement with the world and a violent wrenching loose, a burning hearkening to one's own dark soul, an intoxicating surrender and deep curiosity about the miraculous"
- music as a way of insight into the psyche

"I like listening to music, but only the kind you play, completely unreserved music, the kind that makes you feel that a man is shaking heaven and hell. I believe I love that kind of music because it is amoral. Everything else is so moral that I'm looking for something that isn't"
- rejection of morals and societal influences in his search for self-discovery

"'Not here. Some other time. There, take these.' He reached in his coat, which he had not taken off, and drew out a few roasted chestnuts and threw them to me. I said nothing, took them, ate and felt content"
- very strange scene, almost biblical (catechismistic?)

"As I emerged from my reveries I looked at my companion, his chin resting on his fists, staring fanatically into the ashes with complete surrender"
- surrender to the self, to the unknown?

"Not until I was at home and sat in my little room after supper did it occur to me that I had not heard anything about either Abraxas or Pistorius -- we'd exchanged hardly a dozen words. But I was very satisfied with my visit"
- satisfaction with having a mentor of any kind

"The surrender to Nature's irrational, strangely confused formations produces in us a feeling of inner harmony with the force responsible for these phenomena"
- nature as a force of chaos, but also of harmony with and in that chaos

"it is the same indivisible divinity that is active through us and in Nature, and if the outside world were to be destroyed, a single one of us would be capable of rebuilding it: mountain and stream, tree and leaf, root and flower, yes, every natural form is latent within us, originates in the soul whose essence is eternity"
- not so sure about that, but interesting idea of the thought of nature existing in humanity

"It is obvious how many of them are fish or sheep, worms or angels, how many are ants, how many are bees! Well, each one of them contains the possibility of becoming human, but only by having an intimation of these possibilities, partially even by learning to make himself conscious of them"
- humanity's default is natural savagery, can only attempt to attain humanhood


-- Ch 6

"Pistorius, who was himself a full-grown eccentric, taught me to maintain my courage and self-respect. By always finding something of value in what I said, in my dreams, my fantasies and thoughts, by never making light of them, always giving them serious consideration, he became my model"
- woo role models! second example of such a mentor for Sinclair

"And I could never confess this dream to my friend. I kept it to myself even after I had told him everything else. It was my corner, my secret, my refuge"
- core of his personality, his self

"Christ is not a person for me but a hero, a myth, an extraordinary shadow image in which humanity has painted itself on the wall of eternity"
- super interesting view of religion, as a canvas for humanity to draw its own hopes, a mirror

"live those dreams, play with them, build altars to them. It is not yet the ideal but it points in the right direction. Whether you and I and a few others will renew the world someday remains to be seen. But within ourselves we must renew it each day, otherwise we just aren't serious"
- human power of the creation of our own beliefs 

"But you shouldn't harm and drive away those ideas that make good sense by exorcising them or moralizing about them. Instead of crucifying yourself or someone else you can drink wine from a chalice and contemplate the mystery of the sacrifice"
- almost a kinship with one's own psyche, a connection even to the shadow self

"If you hate a person, you hate something in him that is part of yourself. What isn't part of ourselves doesn't disturb us"
- hate can never truly be directed outwards, just a manifestation of internal turmoil

"'The things we see,' Pistorius said softly, 'are the same things that are within us. There is no reality except the one contained within us. That is why so many people live such an unreal life. They take the images outside them for reality and never allow the world within to assert itself'"
- reality as a function of the self, of the psyche

"So that is how he renews the world within himself! it occurred to me. At the same moment I felt that was a low, moralizing thought. What did I know of his dreams? Perhaps he walked a more certain path in his intoxication than I within my dream"
- I think he's just drunk, but interesting idea of personal forms of worship

"'I don't know much about spirits. I live in my dreams -- that's what you sense. Other people live in dreams, but not in their own. That's the difference'"
- strength in the knowledge of the self

"'Yes, naturally -- if she had no objections,' I said a little derisively"
- wow, Sinclair's being reasonable for once...

"I remembered what Pistorius had told me. But much as I agreed with his ideas I could not pass them on. I was incapable of giving advice that did not derive from my own experience and which I myself did not have the strength to follow"
- importance of honesty, with others and with yourself

"The painted face in the lamplight changed with each exhortation -- became light and luminous, dark and brooding, closed pale eyelids over dead eyes, opened them again and flashed lightning glances. It was woman, man, girl, a little child, an animal, it dissolved into a tiny patch of color, grew large and distinct again"
- face represents humanity itself, and Sinclair's relationship with it: distant but in worship

"Then I thought I could dimly remember that I had burned it. Or had this been in my dream that I burned it in the palm of my hand and swallowed the ashes?"
- ...what?

"'Now go home and don't say a word to anyone! You were on the wrong path. We aren't pigs as you seem to think, but human beings. We create gods and struggle with them, and they bless us'"
- I find this super interesting, the idea that humanity has the power of creation; creation of the self, of worlds, and of gods. 

"What invigorated me was the progress I had made in discovering my self, the increasing confidence in my own dreams, thoughts, and intimations, and the growing knowledge of the power I possessed within me"
- individuation!

"Sooner or later each of us must take the step that separates him from his father, from his mentors; each of us must have some cruelly lonely experience -- even if most people cannot take much of this and soon crawl back"
- more individuation, very Jungian

"He had given me faith in myself. And now I became conscious of gradually beginning to resist him. There was too much didacticism in what he said, and I felt that he understood only a part of me completely"
- break from mentors, continuation of the process of individuation

"I wanted to say something encouraging to him, implore his forgiveness, assure him of my love and my deep gratitude. Touching words came to mind -- but I could not utter them. I just lay there gazing into the fire and kept silent. He, too, kept silent and so we lay while the fire dwindled, and with each dying flame I felt something beautiful, intimate irrevocably burn low and become evanescent"
- theme of honesty, cannot deny the schism between mentor and student

"His ideal way 'antiquarian,' he was seeking in the past, he was a romantic. And suddenly I realized deeply within me: what Pistorius had been and given to me was precisely what he could not be and give to himself. He had led me along a path that would transcend and leave even him, the leader, behind"
- Pistorious very much as the mentor archetype

"During that walk I felt for the first time the mark of Cain on my forehead"
- sort of gone full circle, now Sinclair is present of the fact he's "special"

"He lingered too fondly in the past, his knowledge of this past was too precise, he knew too much about Egypt and India, Mithras and Abraxas. His love was shackled to images the earth had seen before, and yet, in his inmost heart, he realized that the New had to be truly new and different, that it had to spring from fresh soil and could not be drawn from museums and libraries"
- worship as innately temporal, cannot be chained to the past or present

"It was wrong to desire new gods, completely wrong to want to provide the world with something. An enlightened man had but one duty -- to seek the way to himself, to reach inner certainty, to grope his way forward, no matter where it led"
- total rejection of Pistorious' thoughts, important step in Sinclair's individuation

"But I must always have things around me that I feel are beautiful and sacred, organ music and mysteries, symbols and myths. I need and cannot forgo them. That is my weakness. Sometimes, Sinclair, I know that I should not have such wishes, that they are a weakness and luxury"
- interesting view, everthing other than the self as a weakness, a tether

"Someone who seeks nothing but his own fate no longer has any companions, he stands quite alone and has only cold universal space around him"
- true individuation


-- Ch 7

"I felt my fate drawing me on, I felt the moment of my fulfillment coming near and I was sick with impatience at not being able to do anything"
- powerlessness within the stream of fate

"Under a street lamp I saw his yellow face light up in a smile"
- yikes, some of this has not aged well

"All this false communion -- from the fraternities to the choral societies and the nations themselves -- was an inevitable development, was a community born of fear and dread, out of embarrassment, but inwardly rotten, outworn, close to collapsing"
- community as the opposite of individuation, and as such is fundamentally unsustainable

"'You are only afraid if you are not in harmony with yourself. People are afraid because they have never owned up to themselves. A whole society composed of men afraid of the unknown within them!'"
- this did age well, still important today

"'Whether the workers kill the manufacturers or whether Germany makes war on Russia will merely mean a change of ownership. But it won't have been entirely in vain. It will reveal the bankruptcy of present-day ideals, there will be a sweeping away of Stone Age gods. The world, as it is now, wants to die, wants to perish -- and it will'"
- hints at a cyclical nature within human history, of tension and revolution

"'No, what Nature wants of man stands indelibly written in the individual, in you, in me. It stood written in Jesus, it stood written in Nietzsche. These tendencies -- which are the only important ones and which, of course, can assume different forms every day -- will have room to breathe once the present societies have collapsed'"
- the most significant people simply as extensions or agents of the natural world

"I felt that an important day had begun for me and I saw and experienced the changed world around me, expectant, meaningful, and solemn; even the gentle autumn rain had its beauty and a calm and festive air full of happy, sacred music. For the first time the outer world was perfectly attuned to the world within; it was a joy to be alive"
- return to the childhood innocence which frees one to see the natural world

"That was how the world had appeared to me in the mornings when I was a small boy, on the great feast days, at Christmas or Easter. I had forgotten that the world could still be so lovely"
- purity and innocence as fundamentally natural states

"'One never reaches home,' she said. 'But where paths that have affinity for each other intersect the whole world looks like home, for a time'"
- home as a artificial construct, something which can be approached but never reached

"'Yes, you must find your dream, then the way becomes easy. But there is no dream that lasts forever, each dream is followed by another, and one should not cling to any particular one'"
- temporality of purpose as a whole

"Outside was reality: streets and houses, people and institutions, libraries and lecture halls -- but here inside was love; here lived the legend and the dream"
- new dichotomy, the "real" world vs this new one

"Humanity -- which they loved as we did -- was for them something complete that must be maintained and protected. For us, humanity was a distant goal toward which all men were moving, whose image no one knew, whose laws were nowhere written down"
- humanity as an ideal rather than a reality

"Although we might not have been able to express it, we all felt distinctly that a new birth amid the collapse of this present world was imminent, already discernible"
- cyclical world histories, more of a sin wave than an upwards slope

"All men who have had an effect on the course of human history, all of them without exception, were capable and effective only because they were ready to accept the inevitable"
- fatalism, acceptance of the flow of time, but not necessarily the acknowledgement of their own powerlessness

"He had not understood how to love. If at the instant of leaping he had had the strength of faith in the fulfillment of his love he would have soared into the heights and been united with the star"
- not quite sure if that's true, but the idea of love as a power to shape realit is interesting.

"Sometimes I felt certain that it was not she as a person whom I was attracted to and yearned for with all my being, but that she existed only as a metaphor of my inner self, a metaphor whose sole purpose was to lead me more deeply into myself"
- hmm, some fourth-wall-breaking going on here

"Then a loose, yellow cloud swept across the sky, collided with the other, gray bank of cloud. In a few seconds the wind had fashioned a shape out of this yellow and blue-gray mass, a gigantic bird that tore itself free of the steel-blue chaos and flew off into the sky with a great beating of wings"
- someone was tripping out of their mind when they went up there (also, biblical imagery of going up a mountain)

"The world wants to renew itself. There's a smell of death in the air. Nothing can be born without first dying. But it is far more terrible than I had thought"
- more of the theme of a cyclical world history


-- Ch 8

"Yet at any moment this happiness could produce in me the deepest melancholy, for I knew very well that it could not last. It was not my lot to breathe fullness and comfort, I needed the spur of tormented haste"
- the tortured artist, ephemeral nature of happiness

"People will love it. Even now they can hardly wait for the killing to begin -- their lives are that dull! But you will see, Sinclair, that this is only the beginning. Perhaps it will be a very big war, a war on a gigantic scale. But that, too, will only be the beginning. The new world has begun and the new world will be terrible for those clinging to the old"
- phoenix imagery almost, more cycle theme

"How strange that the stream of the world was not to bypass us any more, that it now went straight through our hearts, and that now or very soon the moment would come when the world would need us, when it would seek to transform itself"
- the "stream of the world" controlled by the people who experience it

"All men seemed to have become brothers -- overnight. They talked of 'the fatherland' and of 'honor,' but what lay behind it was their own fate whose unveiled face they had now all beheld for one brief moment"
- strength through the ability to see one's own fate or purpose

"Deep down, underneath, something was taking shape. Something akin to a new humanity. For I could see many men -- and many died beside me -- who had begun to feel acutely that hatred and rage, slaughter and annihilation, were not bound up with these objectives"
- same as the idea that hate can only be directed inwards, the change was a subconscious desire imbedded in the psyche of humanity

"They found me near the poplar tree, covered with earth and with many wounds"
- well maybe next time get out of the way of a shell

"Dressing the wound hurt. Everything that has happened to me since has hurt. But sometimes when I find the key and climb deep into myself where the images of fate lie aslumber in the dark mirror, I need only bend over that dark mirror to behold my own image, now completely resembling him, my brother, my master"
- I love this ending paragraph. power in the recognition of one's fate in one's self
