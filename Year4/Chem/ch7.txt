47. Carbon absorbs energy at a wavelength of 150. nm. The total amount of energy emitted by a carbon sample is 1.98 x 10^5 J. Calculate the number of carbon atoms present in the sample, assuming that each atom emits one photon.

E_1 = hc/λ
E_1 = (6.626 x 10^-34 J * s) * (299,792,458 m/s) / (1.50 x 10^-7 m)
E_1 = 1.32 x 10^-18 J
n = 1.98 x 10^5 J / 1.32 x 10^-18 J
n = 1.5 x 10^23

53. Calculate the de Broglie wavelength for each of the following.

a. an electron with a velocity of 10.% the speed of light

λ = h/mv
λ = (6.626 x 10^-34 J * s) / ((9.10938356 × 10^-31 kg) * (29,979,245.8 m/s))
λ = 2.4 × 10^-11 m

b. a tennis ball (55 g) served at 35 m/s

λ = h/mv
λ = (6.626 x 10^-34 J * s) / ((0.055 kg) * (35 m/s))
λ = 3.446 × 10^-34 m

72. Identify each of the following orbitals and determine the n and l quantum numbers. Explain your answers.
a. n = 3, l = p; it looks like a p orbital but has 1 node
b. n = 2, l = s; it is an s orbital, but has 1 node

91. Given the valence electron orbital level diagram and the description, identify the element or ion.
a. a ground state atom:
3s(ud) 3p(ud|u|u)
S
b. an atom in an excited state (assume two electrons occupy the 1s orbital)
2s(u) 2p(ud|u|u)
N
c. a ground-state ion with a charge of -1
4s(ud) 4p(ud|ud|u)
Fe^-

103. Consider the ground-state electron configurations for Li, N, Ni, Te, Ba, and Hg. Which of these atoms would be expected to be paramagnetic, and how many unpaired electrons are present in each paramagnetic atom?
Li: 1 unpaired
N: 1 unpaired

109. In each of the following sets, which atom or ion has the smallest radius?

He

Cl
c. element 120, element 119, element 116
116
d. Nb, Zn, Si
Si
e. Na^-, Na, Na^+
Na^+

115. Consider the following ionization energies for aluminum:
Al(g) -> Al^+(g) + e^-			I_1 = 580 kJ/mol
Al^+(g) -> Al^2+(g) + e^-		I_2 = 1815 kJ/mol
Al^2+(g) -> Al^3+(g) + e^-		I_3 = 2740 kJ/mol
Al^3+(g) -> Al^4+(g) + e^-		I_4 = 11,600 kJ/mol
a. account for the trend in the values of the ionization energies
The ionization energies go up because it becomes progressively more and more difficult to remove electrons
b. explain the large increase between I_3 and I_4
I_4 results in Al loosing its entire 3 shell, requiring significantly more energy

119. The electron affinities of the elements from aluminum to chlorine are -44, -120, -74, -200.4, and -3847 kJ/mol, respectively. Rationalize the trend in these values.
I'm not sure. It seems as though the alternating affinities are due to the pairing of electrons, but that doesn't seem to make sense because all of the electrons from Al to P are unpaired.
