Questions on Ethics of Legalizing Euthanasia

1. Two Points on Sanctity of Life and Brief Description of Each

- Vitalism: the extreme that tries to deify life by making an idol out of biological existence, no cost is too great
- Utilitarian: values life for its usefulness, says only the strongest and fittest should survive (leads to under treatment)

2. What is the Middle Position?

- recognize we have limited dominion over life
- we are stewards of life
- should care for life and promote it
- respect life in all forms and stages
- positive: nurture and support life
- negative: not to harm life

3. Two Main Points To Prohibit Killing (brief description of each)

- no moral difference between killing and allowing to die: once you decide life should not be sustained, the way you go about it makes no difference
- qualified moral difference: there is difference between killing and letting die, but can be acceptable when certain conditions are met, when someone is in permanent pain, can no longer live, or is beyond the reach of medical care

4. Five main principles and brief description of each.

- middle principle: recognizing circumstances in which our domain over life ends
- prohibition of killing: there is (or isn't) a difference between letting someone die and killing them
- principle of autonomy: the right to self determination
- the common good: beneficial to society as a whole
- virtue: does it create the right relationship between the physician and the patient

5. Choose ONE of the Five Main Points (in #4) and share your reflective thoughts on it -- agree or disagree and reasoning. 

I think the second principle is interesting, because it leads to many areas of discussion. I agree that at some point there isn't a difference between letting someone die and killing them, so in that way I agree more with the middle position, because I think that while there are many situations in which people should be allowed to have access to assisted suicide, it would not be helpful to have that option in all areas of life.
