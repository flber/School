1) Calculate the moment of inertia of the apparatus using measurements of the length and mass of each component. Show and label each step of the calculation.

```
1/12 * (2(0.1277 kg + 0.7279 kg) + 0.3337 kg) * (2(0.025 m + 0.305 m) + 0.072 m)^2
0.09129 kg m^2
```


2) Perform two experiments using different hanging masses, record Ө, t, m, Δy, and r in a data table format.


3) Draw a free body diagram showing and labeling all forces and torques.


4) Write the two Newton’s second law equations derived from the free body diagram.


5) Use the experimental data to calculate I for the apparatus. Show each mathematical step. Provide a caption describing the purpose of each step.


6) Compare the calculated I with the experimentally determined I. Analyze sources of error associated with each method used to determine I.
