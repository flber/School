Physics Notes

Momentum:
p = mv
F(net) = Δp / Δt

m_av_a + m_bv_b = m_av'_a + m_bv'_b

Impulse = FΔt

If momentum and energy are conserver, the collision is elastic. If energy is not conserved, the collision is inelastic. 

For elastic collisions:
v_a + v_a' = v_b' + v_b

conversion of horizontal velocity to upward movement
h = v^2 / 2g

Momentum is conserved in two dimensions


Center of mass:

x_cm = (m_1x_1 + m_2x_2) / (m_1 + m_2)


Angular acceleration

α = a/r

Torque

an application of a force to cause something to rotate, distance from point of rotation increases torque

τ = r⊥F

τ = mr^2α

Στ = (Σmr^2)α

Rotational inertia:

I = Σmr^2

(solid cylinder: I = 0.5mr^2)

τ = Iα



----------

Electricity

static electricity:
	objects can be charged by rubbing
	charge can be negative or positive, attract

electrical charge:
	is conserved

in atoms:
	protons: positive
	electrons: negative 
	polar: neutral overall, charge not evenly distributed

in materials:
	conductors:
		charge flows freely
		metals
	insulator:
		almost no charge flow
		most other materials
	some materials are semiconductors
	
induced charge:
	metals can be charged through conduction
	metals can also be charged through induction
	nonconductors cannot be charged by either conduction or induction, just polarizes

Coulomb's law:
	F = k(Q₁*Q₂)/r^2
	k = 8.988 x 10^9 N*m^2/C^2
	electron = 1.602 x 10^-19 C
	for an electric field:
		E = k(Q/r^2)
		F = qE
		E is a vector

electric fields:
	no fields lines in a conductor
	field lines pass through conductors
	electric fields are perpendicular to surface of conductors
