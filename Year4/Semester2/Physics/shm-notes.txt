Simple Harmonic Motion Notes

Amplitude: max displacement
Frequency: oscillations / sec
Period: sec/oscillation

Requires:
	1. net force in the opposite direction
	2. net for proportional to displacement

Examples:
	1. mass-spring oscillator
	2. pendulum

Mass-spring:
	- Max force at ends, vectors toward equilibrium
	- F = kx
	- F = 0 at equilibrium
	- max acceleration is same x as max force
	- a = ∑F/m
	- v = 0 at A = max
	- v = max at x = 0
	- v_max = √(kx_max^2 / m)
	- KE_max = 1/2mv_max^2
	- a = 0 @ x = 0
	- k: N/m

Oscillations:
	- T_s = 2π√(m/k)
	- T_p = 2π√(l/g)
