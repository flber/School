## Analysis

Initial volumes and molarities of ions were multiplied to find initial moles

| Solution | initial moles Fe^3+ | initial moles SCN^- |
|:--------:|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|
|     1    |       1x10^-5       |       2x10^-6       |
|     2    |       1x10^-5       |       4x10^-6       |
|     3    |       1x10^-5       |       6x10^-6       |
|     4    |       1x10^-5       |       8x10^-6       |
|     5    |       1x10^-5       |       1x10^-5       |

The concentrations of FeSCN^2+ were found by dividing each absorbance number by the constant found last class (3820)

0.066 / 3820 = 1.7 x 10^-5 M
0.170 / 3820 = 4.5 x 10^-5 M
0.251 / 3820 = 6.6 x 10^-5 M
0.342 / 3820 = 9.0 x 10^-5 M
0.423 / 3820 = 1.1 x 10^-4 M

These concentrations were then multiplied by volume to find moles of FeSCN^2+ at equilibrium

1.7 x 10^-5 M * 0.1 L = 1.7 x 10^-6
4.5 x 10^-5 M * 0.1 L = 4.5 x 10^-6
6.6 x 10^-5 M * 0.1 L = 6.6 x 10^-6
9.0 x 10^-5 M * 0.1 L = 9.0 x 10^-6
1.1 x 10^-4 M * 0.1 L = 1.1 x 10^-5

I am unfortunately unable to find the equilibrium concentrations for the reactants.
