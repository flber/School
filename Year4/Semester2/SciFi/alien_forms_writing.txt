Her footsteps echoed off the marble floor, its surface perfectly reflecting the inky shadows far above, and disappeared into the cavernous expanse of its mind. The journey up the mountain range which was all that was left of the Colossus’ spine had taken days of walking between ribs and broken bones of metal which leaned precariously, like poorly constructed skyscrapers. Thin beams of light from the sinking star outside streamed down at a shallow angle through the orbital fissures, illuminating the dunes of old paper within. An entire world’s knowledge had been sacrificed here, offered to a saviour created with the hope that it could solve their problems. The craters and deserts which still marred the planet’s surface were testaments to their failure; even a giant with the power to move mountains and the knowledge to answer any question could not change their nature. As she walked further into the desert of knowledge forgotten by all except the remnants of the Colossus' mind, the last trickle of red light faded away, leaving the skull in a soft darkness. The sound of moving paper seemed to pick up then; dunes shifting in a wind which came from nowhere. Looking up, she noticed small gold lights, though they couldn't have been stars. In the almost imperceptible breeze, a paper was lifted from a far off dune and made its way toward her, landing at her feet. She leaned down to pick it up, moving other papers aside. The paper almost broke apart from that light motion, and though most of the words were gone, erased by time and forgotten, she could make out the words "Who am I?". She had no answer for it, and the dunes seemed to sigh at her silence.
