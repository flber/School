Chem ch 2 Notes

-- scientists
Boyle: pressure and volume
Stahl: combustion & "phlogiston"
Lavoisier: law of conservation of mass
Proust: law of definite proportions
Dalton: atomic theory, law of multiple proportions, table of atomic masses
Lussac: volumes of reacting gases
Avogadro: at the same temp & pressure, equal volumes of different gases contain the same number of particles
Thomson: found electrons with cathode ray tubes, determined charge-to-mass, plum pudding model
Millikan: oil drop experiment, determined mass of electron
Rutherford: disproved plum pudding model with foil and alpha particles, found nucleus


-- naming
Type I binary ionic compounds
  - normal salts and such
Type II binary ionic compounds
  - with metals
  - specify metal charge
Oxygen ions
  hypo- -ite : 1 O
  -ite : 2 O
  -ate : 3 O
  per- -ate : 4 O
(Type III) Binary covalent compounds
  - first element is prefixed with number root (never mono)
  - second is also prefixed and has -ide suffix
Acids
  - w/o oxygen:
    - hydro- (anion root) -ic
  - hypo- -ite: hypo- -ous
  - -ite: -ous
  - -ate: -ic
  - per- -ate: per- -ic
