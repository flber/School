Carl Jung and theories of Consciousness

The Pysche: a personal consciousness
  - The Persona
    - in the ego
    - the aspects which are formed in response to the surroundings
    - based on fundamental characteristics of the physche, but superficial
    - problems when persona doesn't fit, or overfits
  - The Shadow
    - stored in personal unconscious
    - opposite to qualities manifested in the persona
    - not always negative, just repressed & rejected
    - Projection
      - finding what you don't like in yourself in others
  - The Anima
    - personification of feminine traits in the male pysche
    - shaped by relationship with mother
  - The Animus
    - masculine traits in the female pysche
    - shaped by relationship with father
  - The Objects
    - the image of an ideal person
    - affects other elements
    - putting someone on a pedestal
    - problematic; removes individuality of others

- Process of Individuation: the journey to the true self
  - Becoming who we authentically are
  - Requires being alone at times
  - Most people never achieve the "final" goal
  - The acceptance of dualities
