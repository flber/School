1. Tell a story from your life, describing an experience that either demonstrates your character or helped to shape it. (max 650 words)

A couple of years ago, my friend and I decided to build a drone together. He had built a lot of small racing quads previously, but had never built a larger fixed-wing UAV. I had never built a drone, period, so we both knew we were in for an interesting experience. Though we both had a lot of schoolwork, as I think we decided to begin building the drone right around finals, we tried to get together on weekends to work. We ended up spending months in his garage, putting that drone together by hand, every little piece. It was a fixed-wing, pusher-prop drone with a wingspan a little over three feet and an estimated range of fifty miles. We built our own head-tracking module, 3d-printed and attached to the drone, so when we turned our heads while wearing the FPV goggles for drone flying, the camera on the drone would tilt and look around the same way, allowing for better field of view while flying. We spent at least two weeks painting the foam fuselage, grey on the bottom and blue on the top. We even coated the wings in a plastic wrap to improve the aerodynamics, which took painstaking hours with an iron to fuse with the foam body. We hand-soldered every component, connecting the flight controller, GPS module, receiver, servos, battery, and far too many other smaller components to count. Then came the endless tweaking and trimming before we ever got off the ground, making sure the center of gravity was centered between the wings, making sure our control surfaces could move far enough to steer our quite heavy drone. While my friend was quite familiar with all of the tools and electronics required for our endeavor, I was a bit rustier when it came to soldering or splicing wires. So for me it was also a very educational experience, and the thought of our drone crashing if I did something wrong made sure I double and triple checked the quality of my work. I cannot be sure how many hours we spent working on it, but it took almost a year to finish, with both of us working on other projects at the same time. After all of those months, we finally figured that it was as good to go as we could get it without a test flight, and we set out for our maiden voyage. The only problem was that neither of us could drive at that point, and my friend did not live particularly close to any parks. The closest one was maybe a couple miles away, down the hill, across a freeway. Though neither of us had cars, my friend did have an relatively large electric scooter. Unfortunately, he only had the one electric scooter. We ended up getting to the field with him sitting on the scooter on top of a box of electronics, with me holding on to him, standing up, with about four inches of contact between my shoes and the scooter. Getting through traffic to the field was interesting, to say the least. We somehow made it to the baseball field, and unloaded our small best-buys worth of spare electronics, in case we needed to do some field patches on our drone. But, other than the scarring scooter ride it was a perfect day, we had the field to ourselves and the weather was great. We started to get our drone set up, plugged in the battery, got our FPV goggles and controllers ready, and launched prepared for the first flight. My friend took the first flight, and as I threw the drone into the air it just barely seemed to make it and gain altitude. The control surfaces seemed to be a bit sluggish, and it was worryingly nose heavy. With this in mind he landed it again, and after some quick fixes we launched again, this time with my flying. My friend launched it, and I slowly began to gain some altitude. We were in a small valley, with eucalyptus on three sides of us, the third side being the freeway. We launched toward the freeway, as it offered us the most distance to take off, but I quickly had to turn to avoid flying over the freeway. Turning it around, I noticed that the controls were very slow, and the drone wanted to descend. I noticed the trees too late. I floored the throttle and attempted to turn before I crashed into those sixty-foot-tall eucalyptus, but the drone wasn't responsive enough, and tore through the canopy. In an instant, a year of work was reduced into debris.
