1. ∫(π, 2π) sin x dx
-2; as this is simply the base equation shifted by π. In the sine wave this corresponds to a dip opposite of the first rise.

2. ∫(0, 2π) sin x dx
0; over the period (0, 2π) the sine wave ends where it begins.

3. ∫(0, π/2) sin x dx
1: 1/2 of the initial period results in 1/2 the area

4. ∫(0, 2π) (2 + sin x) dx
12.57; not really sure how to explain this, but this is what I got from graphing it.

5. ∫(0, π) 2 sin x dx
4; doubling the height of the original equation doubles the area.

6. ∫(2, π+2) sin(x - 2) dx
2; this is just the base equation moved right by 2.

7. ∫(-π, π) sin u du
0; the areas across the y-axis cancel each other out.

8. ∫(0, 2π) sin(x/2) dx
4; this stretches the original wave's first rise out to 2π, doubling the area.

9. ∫(0, π) cos x dx
0; (0, π) on a cosine wave goes from a peak to a trough, and the areas cancel out.

10. Suppose k is any positive number. Make a conjecture about ∫(-k, k) sin x dx
∫(-k, k) sin x dx will always be zero.
