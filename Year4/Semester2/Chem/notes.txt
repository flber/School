Chem Notes


chemical equilibrium:

- reactants or products can be favored
- visible changes cannot be detected in reactions at equilibrium
	- equilibrium is not static, but equally dynamic

law of mass action (multiply top and bottom terms if > 1):
k = [p]^c_p / [r]^c_r
(if k is > 1 is favors products)

equilibrium position: 
	- refers to each set of equilibrium concentrations
equilibrium constant:
	- one constant for a particular system at a particular temperature

heterogeneous equilibria:
(pure) solids and liquids don't affect the law of mass action, and should not be included in the equilibrium constant equation

Spectral analysis

compares incident of light I_0 to the intensity of light after it has passed through the sample I. The ratio I/I_0, called the transmittance, is a measure of the fraction of light that passes through the sample. 

The amount of light absorbance is given by

A = -log(I/I_0)

The absorbance can be expressed by the Beer-Lambert law:

A = εlc

where ε is the molar absorptivity or the molar extinction coefficient (in L/mol * cm), l is the distance light travels through the solution (in cm), and c is the concentration of the absorbing species (in mol/L)
