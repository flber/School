Physics Notes

Ch 4

F_n = mg cos(theta)
F_p = mg sin(theta)

mg sin(theta) = μmg cos(theta)
sin(theta) = μ cos(theta)
μ = tan(theta)
theta = tan^-1(μ)


Ch 5

Uniform circular motion: motion in a circle of constant radius at a constant speed

centripetal acceleration points toward the center of the circle:
a_r = v^2 / r


Ch 5.5

Law of universal gravitation:

F_g = G((m_1*m_2)/r^2)
G = 6.67 x 10^-11 N*m^2/kg^2

v = sqrt(Gm/r)

mv^2/r = Gm*m_2/r^2


Ch 6

w = ΔKE
Fd = KE
Fd = 1/2mv^2
F(avg) = mv^2 / 2d

F_s = -kx
where k is the spring constant

PE_el = 1/2kx^2

Power = work/time
1 W = 1 J/s

elastic kinetic energy = 1/2 kh^2
