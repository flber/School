2. Every person has a creative side, and it can be expressed in many ways: problem solving, original and innovative thinking, and artistically, to name a few. Describe how you express your creative side.

I like to think of myself as a generalist, and I always enjoy practicing new ways to express my ideas. Most of my projects are software-oriented, which often necessitate multiple kinds of thinking. My most recent project is a blog / personal wiki / digital garden I built from the ground up, where I talk about projects I've been worked on, ideas I've had, and tools I'm using. The site itself is built using several different technologies, a couple of which I had to learn for the project. I found making the site generator very rewarding, and much of my time was spent making the site code small and efficient, without sacrificing style. That sort of problem is one of my favorite types of creative expression, but I've also been writing articles and drawing diagrams for the site. I recently have been practicing more creative drawing as well, using a very nice digital drawing tool called "noodle", the sketches of which I've put up on my site. I've been doing this sort of creative documentation for longer than I can remember, mostly writing and drawing in a collection of memo notebooks. One of my earliest drawings I still have is something that looks like a phone with a spider web on in, crudely drawn in colored pencil, with the label "sonar", which I vaguely remember as being an idea for a device with sonar in it. My drawings (and ideas) have gotten a bit better than they were then, but I still always have a memo notebook on me in case I want to write down an idea or a sketch.

3. What would you say is your greatest talent or skill? How have you developed and demonstrated that talent over time?



5. Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?

The most significant (and embarrassing) challenge I have faced was one entirely of my own making. For the past two years I've been working on an implementation of the wave function collapse algorithm, which is essentially a tool to generate patterns from input images. I had a github repository set up for it, but little did I know that over most of the summer I forgot to update it. At some point toward the end of summer I had to send my laptop to get serviced, and when it came back it was wiped, which I had expected. What I hadn't expected, however, was that I lost three months of work on my algorithm. What made this so much worse is that while I was waiting for my laptop to get back I actually came up with a solution to a problem in the algorithm which I had been stuck on for the last three weeks or so, and I knew exactly what I needed to do to almost finish the algorithm. While there was nothing I could do to get back all of that lost time and progress, since then I have automated the updating of my github repositories, meaning I should never lose that much work again. This newfound respect for and fear of backing up work has carried over into school, as I also keep all of my school work in a github repository. This helps me deal with having two households, and having a digital copy of every school assignment I've done means I don't need to worry as much about losing notes or work when I go between houses.

6. Think about an academic subject that inspires you. Describe how you have furthered this interest inside and/or outside of the classroom.

One of my favorite classes I've taken so far during high school was AP computer science A. Though the first time I was exposed to programming was the summer going into 7th grade, which I spent in a Minecraft modding camp, and then later that year learning Processing in 7th grade, APCSA in my sophomore year was really the first formal class I ever had in computer science. Though I don't think anyone would call writing native Java with a pen and paper fun, I certainly found it interesting and rewarding, especially because it was fun to be one of the few sophomores in the class. Because my high school does not offer any more advanced computer science classes, after that class I spent a lot more time delving deeper into computer science on my own. I created my github account at the start of my sophomore year, and since then I've worked on personal projects, helped with a couple public repositories, and learned everything from Javascript to a bit of 6502 assembly. My personal projects have ranged from games to bash utilities, and I'm currently working on my website, a game, and miscellaneous terminal utilities, though I'm also interested in learning more about C, assembly, and integrated software. The tools that I make and skills that I learn are also often helpful with school, for example I recently made a bash utility that can print out a periodic table, return data about specific elements, and find the molar mass of molecules. I'm always excited to learn more about computer science in general, and I find it very rewarding to implement the skills I learn.
