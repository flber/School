## The Sands of Time

Her footsteps echoed off the marble floor, its surface perfectly reflecting the inky shadows far above. The journey up the mountain range which was all that was left of the Colossus’ spine had taken days of walking between ribs and broken bones of metal which leaned precariously, like poorly constructed skyscrapers. Thin beams of red light from the sinking star outside streamed down at a shallow angle through the orbital fissures, illuminating the dunes of old paper within. An entire world’s knowledge had been sacrificed here, offered to a being created with the hope that it could solve their problems. The craters and deserts which still marred the planet’s surface all these millenia later were testaments to their failure; even a giant with the power to move mountains and the knowledge to answer any question could not change their nature. 
​		Alone in the sea of paper, her task felt impossible. The search for life on this planet any larger than algae went back into time immemorial, and had transformed her people into a loose collection of nomadic wanderers. They subsisted on chemicals collected from the dust, transformed into carbohydrates and proteins in the bioreactors which they carried with them. She had been traveling on her own for decades, as so many of them did, crossing desolate plains etched with the scars of that final war and mountains weathered down by wind and time. 
​		As she walked further into the desert of knowledge forgotten by all except the remnants of the Colossus' mind, the last trickle of red light faded away, leaving the skull in a soft darkness. The sound of moving paper seemed to pick up then; dunes shifting in a quiet wind which came from nowhere. Looking around, she realized she could no longer tell where she had come from; the dunes had shifted and hidden the path behind her. In an almost imperceptible breeze, a paper was lifted from a far off dune and made its way toward her, landing at her feet. She leaned down to pick it up, moving other sheets aside. The paper almost broke apart from that light motion, and though most of the words were gone, erased by time, she could make out the words, “   .  -  rest, now    `     …  and travel   ‘       ~ nø longer   ^  _    ”
​	The paper was carried back into the darkness as she dropped it, and she asked the wind in a hushed voice, “What do you know? What have you been hiding?” 
A path slowly revealed itself, lit by paper with glowing writing, winding off into the dunes. As she followed the path deeper into the desert the wind began to pick up, the dunes rustling like dry leaves. 
[...]
​	She struggled up an enormous dune of parchment, the sheets shifting and whispering with each step as she slowly ascended. Finally, at the crest of the dune she spotted a bright green mass below her, which appeared to be contained in a larger glass building. Looking down, she struggled to make out what it was. Was it a collection of algae? Some sort of mineral deposit?
