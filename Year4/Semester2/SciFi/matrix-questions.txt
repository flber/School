Open-ended Matrix Seminar questions

1. Cypher ultimately chooses to go back to the matrix, betraying his companions in the real world. Do you think his choice is a reasonable one, based on the argument that if he can't tell the difference, it doesn't matter.

2. In one of Agent Smith's monologues, he mentions that the machines first created a perfect utopia for humans, but that people didn't believe it. Is such a utopia simply unattainable for our species? Neo says he felt like something was wrong when he was in the matrix, so is his unease the result of an ability to believe in a better world, or of some metaphysical sense of the simulation?

3. Who is the Oracle? In the mythology Morpheus tells Neo, the Oracle has been around since the start of the matrix. Is she a human who managed to extend her life? An opposing AI who has a more benevolent attitude toward humans?
