Thermo Prelab Questions

1. Calculate the mass of ammonium chloride required to prepare 25 mL of a 2.0 M solution.
0.025 L * 2.0 M
0.05 mol
54.292 g/mol * 0.05 mol
2.2 g

2. Calculate the mass of calcium chloride required to prepare 25 mL of a 2.0 M solution.
0.025 L * 2.0 M
0.05 mol
110.98 g/mol * 0.05 mol
5.5 g

3. Write the balanced equation for the dissolution of ammonium chloride in water.
NH_4Cl -> NH_4^+ + Cl^-

4. Write the balanced equation for the dissolution of calcium chloride in water.
CaCl_2 -> Ca^2+ + 2Cl^-

5. What does a negative value of ΔH indicate about a reaction?
A negative ΔH means that the reaction is exothermic.

6. What does a negative value of ΔS indicate about a reaction?
It means that a reaction is less likely to be spontaneous.

7. What does a negative value of ΔG indicate about a reaction?
It means that the reaction is spontaneous at the measured conditions.

8. Calculate the heat of solution (q_soln) if the mass of solution is 45.6 g, specific heat is 3.98 J/g °C, and ΔT is -34.5°C.
q_soln = m * H * ΔT
q_soln = 45.6 g * 3.98 J/g °C * -34.5°C
q_soln = -6261.336 (not sure about this one...)

9. What is the heat of reaction (q_rxn) for the above question?
q_rxn = -q_soln
q_rxn = 6261.336

10. If 0.612 moles of salt were used in the reaction, what is ΔH_rxn?
ΔH_rxn = q_rxn / mol
ΔH_rxn = 6261.336 / 0.612 mol
ΔH_rxn = 10230.94
