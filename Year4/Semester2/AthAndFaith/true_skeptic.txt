Where Do You Land as a True Skeptic?


I. So after reading about the early Greek Skeptics and how they believed it is IMPORTANT for people to admit they cannot always "know" everything, but true skeptics are not passive but willing to find out.... HOW does this apply to you now? On the "skepticism meter" (the original one that the Greeks followed)... Which fits you best?

I would say that I am a solid skeptic. I like to try and actually understand answers given to me, and when there is no clear reasoning or evidence I try and come up with my own explanation.


II. If you could ask God ANY question (if you are not sure there is a God, for this one, let's say there is)... What would it be and WHY ask it?

Well, I'd have a lot of questions about how I got into this scenario. However, if I could only ask God one question, I would ask why he created the universe. I think the answer to that question would be the most interesting and all-encompassing response, because it also tells a lot about this God's reasoning.


III. Now, what are TWO THINGS in your life you can be SURE or CERTAIN OF (that exist)-- could be things, people, ideas, emotions, ... and HOW are you certain they exist?  (Share how Des Cartes would reply here)

To Des Cartes' point, the only thing I can be sure of is my own existence. Anything other than that is speculation to some extent, and so I cannot confidently say I am certain of anything else. While that would also be Des Cartes' response, I agree with his philosophy of extreme (though not necessarily practical) uncertainty.
