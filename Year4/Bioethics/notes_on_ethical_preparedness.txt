Notes on Article from Markkula Center For Applied Ethics: "Ethical Preparedness for Pandemic Influenza: A Tool Kit"

- Intro
	- in 1918, 20-40 million people died from influenza
	- primary obligation of health officials is to plan
	- toolkit reviews planning and ethics, and suggests steps
- Purpose
	- aid disaster planners
	- provides ethical background to disaster response
	- guiding principles are suggested
- A background
	- most countries have plans for pandemics but not ethics
	- New Zealand and Canada do
	- primarily espouse responsiveness and openness
- CDC Ethical Guidelines
	- rights can be infringed upon, but no more than needed
	- "nessecary" people should have priority
	- advanced prep must be made
- VA
	- duty to provide care for patients even at personal risk
	- employer's duty to provide decent work environment
- Obligation to plan
	- planning leads to better (more ethical) action
	- plan must:
		- maximise preparedness
		- be implemented fairly
		- be open and transparent
- Alternative Care Centers
	- pandemic will last a long time
	- planning also involves assumptions about core values
- Triage Guidelines
	- rationing must minimize harm
	- procedural justice
		- requires protocol developed to provide guidance
		- maximize help for people
		- most at risk should be helped most
	- distributive justice
		- many ways to prioritize aid
		- can save most people, but difficult to implement
		- utilitarianism can lead to injustice
		- CDC recommends modulating pure utilitarianism
		- second goal is to minimize suffering of impacted
- Applying Principles of Justice
	- admission and denial of admission
	- first come, first serve has issues
	- minimize health and social impacts
	- prioritize essential personnel may be best
	- process should be transparent and open to input
- Restrictive Measures
	- autonomy can be restricted when minimizes risk of harm
	- such decisions weigh freedom against common good
	- isolation should only happen w/ scientific oversight
	- evidence-based model
	- plans should be made in advance
- Next Step
	- framework should be developed
	- decisions should be heavily reviewed
	- should also address how to keep society functioning
	- issues need to be publicly vetted before a crisis
