13. Suppose a reaction has the equilibrium constant k = 1.3 x 10^8. What does the magnitude of this constant tell you about the relative concentrations of products and reactants that will be present once equilibrium is reached? Is this reaction likely to be a good source of the products?

This reaction will likely produce far more reactants than products, so it will be a good source of the products.


14. suppose a reaction has the equilibrium constant k = 1.7 x 10^-8 at a particular temperature. Will there be a large or small amount of unreacted starting material present when this reaction reaches equilibrium? Is this reaction likely to be a good source of products at this temperature?

There will be a large amount of unreacted starting material at equilibrium, so it will not be a good source of the products at this temperature.


15. Consider the following reaction at some temperature: 

H_2O(g) + CO(g) <=> H_2 (g) + CO_2(g) | k = 2.0

Some molecules of H_2O and CO are placed in a 1.0 L container as shown below:

H_2O: 8
CO: 6

When equilibrium is reached, how many molecules of H_2O, CO, H_2, and CO_2 are present? Do this problem by trial and error - that is, if two molecules of CO react, is this equilibrium; if three molecules of CO react, is this equilibrium; and so on.

2: 2*2/4*6
3: 3*3/3*5
4: 4*4/2*4 <- eql: 2 mol H_2O, 4 mol CO, 4 mol H_2, 4 mol CO_2


33. Write expressions for k and k_p for the following reactions

a. 2NH_3(g) + CO_2(g) <=> N_2CH_4O(s) + H_2O(g)
b. 2NBr_3(s) <=> N_2 (g) + 3Br_2(g)
c. 2KClO_3(s) <=> 2KCl(s) + 3O_2(g)
d. CuO(s) + H_2(g) <=> Cu(l) + H_2O(g)

Not sure how to do this seeing as how we're not given any concentrations or pressures?


38. In a study of the reaction

3Fe(s) + 4H_2O(g) <=> Fe_3O_4(s) + 4H_2(g)

at 1200 K it was observed that when the equilibrium partial pressure of water vapor is 15.0 torr, the total pressure at equilibrium is 36.3 torr. Calculate the value of k_p for this reaction at 1200 K. (Hint: Apply Dalton's law of partial pressures)


39. The equilibrium constant is 0.0900 at 25Â°C for the reaction

H_2O(g) + Cl_2O(g) <=> 2HOCl(g)

For which of the following sets of conditions is the system at equilibrium? For those that are not at equilibrium, in which direction will the system shift?

a. A 1.0 l flask contains 1.0 mole of H)Cl, 0.10 mole of Cl_2, and 0.98 mole of H_2O

b. A 2.0 L flask contains 0.084 mole of HOCl, 0.080 mole if Cl_2O, and 0.98 mole of H_2O

c. A 3.0 L flask contains 0.25 mole of HOCl, 0.0010 mole of Cl_2O, and 0.56 mole of H_2O


56. At a particular temperature, k_p = 0.25 for the reaction 

N_2O_4(g) <=> 2NO_2(g)

a. A flask containing only N_2O_4 at an initial pressure of 4.5 arm is allowed to reach equilibrium. Calculate the equilibrium partial pressures of the gases.

b. A flask containing only NO_2 at an initial pressure of 9.0 atm is allowed to reach equilibrium. Calculate the equilibrium partial pressures of the gases.

c. From your answers to parts a and b, does it matter form which direction an equilibrium position is reached?


59. At a particular temperature, k = 2.0 x 10^-6 for the reaction

2CO_2(g) <=> 2CO(g) + O_2(g)

If 2.0 moles of CO_2 is initially placed into a 5.0 L vessel, calculate the equilibrium concentrations of all species.


63. Suppose the reaction system

UO_2(s) + 4HF(g) <=> UF_4(g) + 2H_2O(g)

has already reached equilibrium. Predict the effect that each of the following changes will have on the equilivrium position. Tell whether the equilibrium will shift to the right, will shift to the left, or will not be affected. 

a. Additional UO_2(s) is added to the system.

b. The reaction is performed in a glass reaction vessel; HF(g) attacks and reacts with glass.

c. Water vapor is removed.


67. In which direction will the position of the equilibrium

2HI(g) <=> H_2(g) + I_2(g)

be shifted for each of the following changes?

a. H_2(g) is added.

b. I_2(g) is removed. 

c. HI(g) is removed. 

d. In a rigid reaction container, some Ar(g) is added.

e. the volume of the container is doubled.

f. The temperature is decreased (the reaction is exothermic)
