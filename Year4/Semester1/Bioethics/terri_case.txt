What?
Whether or not to remove the feeding tube

Who?
Agents: doctors, parents, spouse, government, judges
Subjects: Terri
Social location: upper-middle class white family

Why?
Different emphasis on the value of life, parents wanted to maintain her life at all costs, husband wanted her to die "naturally" after it was clear she was in a persistent vegetative state

How?
She was kept on intensive life support and the argument was played out in courtrooms, the news, and in the hospital

Where/When?
Florida, 1990-2005

Consequences?
She was eventually allowed to die, it set the precedent that the government (including the president) is not allowed to interfere in personal matters, and it reinforced the decision that the spouse, not the parents, is the one who is responsible for someone who is in a vegetative state.

Evaluation:

Values
- value of human life
- autonomy and delegation of autonomy
- suffering vs life
- death with dignity

Options:
- keep her on life support indefinitely
- remove life support when vegetative state is permanent
- no life support to begin with
- argue and take and remove feeding tube cyclically

Decision
I think a morally good decision in this case would be to have taken her off of life support as soon as it was clear that she in a persistent vegetative state. This importantly keeps the event private and prevents it from becoming a national spectacle.
