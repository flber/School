Demian Seminar Questions & Notes

Level 3 Questions

1. With the given assumption that Demain and Eva are elements of Sinclair's psyche, analyze what aspects of his psyche they might be, and then interpret the meaning behind his interactions with them.

2. Given Sinclair's many mentors, why do you think he is so unwilling to give Knauer advice?

Level 4 Questions

1. In the final chapter of the novel, Sinclair comments on how willing people are to fight and die together once they have seen a glimpse of "fate". What is your interpretation of the sudden willingness of European society to go to war in World War I? Was it a vision of fate, or something else?

2. The majority of the novel is focused around an acceptance of good and evil, though it is clearly stated that acceptance does not necessarily equal wholehearted appreciation. What do you think are the benefits and consequences of such a view? Do the benefits to being able to see both sides of the world outweigh the possibility of the existential crisis and seclusion that seem to affect Sinclair?


Notes

- Formative times
	- High school
	- Beatrice
	- Pistorious
	- Also confirmation school, created basis for thinking
	- recovery from drinking was partially self created
- Is Sinclair more competent than Demian by the end
	- still wants to rely on Demian to an extent
	- Demain doesn't have a lot of depth, purely a mentor
	- Star wars: Luke grows stronger than mentors
	- more equal by the end (especially w/ psyche theory)
	- merged, not surpassed
