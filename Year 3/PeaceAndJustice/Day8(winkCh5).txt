--[[Welcome back everyone!! Today we will be reading Wink, chapter 5 and answering some questions about what we read. This reading begins our final unit, “Jesus’ Third Way”/creative non-violence, in which we will be studying different people & movements that have used non-violence to “fight” injustice and oppression. Begin by accessing Wink 5 in the Wink folder (you may also use your text if you have it at home). Read half of the chapter thoughtfully and you should be able to answer the 3 questions below (on a Word/Google Doc) & Schoology submit/”dropbox. Be sure to do your OWN WORK!!

-- 1) What is the Greek word that Wink believes is mistranslated in Matt 5:39a? Explain in some detail the mistranslation. Do you agree with Wink that this was a purposeful mistranslation? According to Wink, what would be an acceptable English translation of Matt 5:39a?
"Wink believes that the word 'antistenai' is mistranslated. In the phrase 'do not resist an evildoer', antistenai is used as 'resist' when its more accurate meaning is to combatitively stand against, as armies would each other. Therefore, the phrase should be more correctly read as 'do not violently fight against an evildoer'. I think it absolutely was a mistranslation, as that mistranslation would have worked quite well in favor of the tyranical king who was having the bible translated. Another, more correct, version of that phrase is 'do not repay evil for evil'."

-- 2) Using two specific quotes from Wink explain in some detail what Jesus was actually advising when he said “Turn the other cheek.” When in your life have you seen this method employed?
"By turning the cheek, the servant makes itimpossible for the master to use the backhand again", "The left cheek now offers a perfect target for a blow with the right fist; but only equals fought with fists, as we know from Jewish sources, and the last thing themaster wishes to do is to establish this underling's equality", "I don't think I've ever seen this specific method used, but it makes a lot of sense, and is amusingly clever. More generally I've used the strategy of not responding to the teasing of my siblings and parents so they'll eventually give up."

-- 3) Using two specific quotes from Wink explain in some detail what Jesus was actually implying when he said, “Give them your shirt as well.” When in your life have you seen this method employed?
"Nakedness was taboo in Judaism, and shame fellless on the naked party than on the person viewing or causing the nakedness (Gen. 9:20-27). By stripping,the debtor has brought shame on the creditor", "The debtor had nohopeof winningthecase; the law was entirely in the creditor's favor. But the poor man has transcended this attempt to humiliate him. He has risen above shame. At the same time,he has registered a stunning protest against the system that created his debt", "Again, I have never seen this method employed, but it makes sense as a tactic to... expose an injust system (pun intended)."
