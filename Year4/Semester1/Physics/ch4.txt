3. The rope must withstand 1450 N

7. The force to stop the car is 11000 N

10. The cable must withstand 12600 N

12. The bucket has an acceleration of 1.84 m/s^2

13. The thief can escape by sliding down the rope with a downward acceleration of 7.6 m/s^2

16. The acceleration of the elevator was 2.5 m/s^2 downward

24. She must pull herself with a force of 72 N, and if that force increases by 15% her acceleration will be 1.15 m/s^2

25. 
a. The tension on the top cord is 6.4 N and the tension on the bottom cord is 3.2 N
b. If the buckets are pulled up with an acceleration of 1.25 m/s^2 the tension on the top cord will be 8 N and the tension on the bottom cord will be 4 N

27. F_t1 will be twice that of F_t2

31. 
a. the angle is 27 degrees
b. It will swing toward the windshield
