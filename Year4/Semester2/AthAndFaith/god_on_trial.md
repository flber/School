## God On Trial Questions: Liebel
Ben Hammond, Liam McFarland, Alexander Sproul

1. *What stood out for you with this character  (background, outlook, feelings, thoughts)*
The story of his three sons seemed to be his primary background characteristic, and that he still believed in god after that trauma.   

2. *What were some points this character made about suffering and God? Do you agree or disagree? Explain.*
One point that he made was "You keep asking 'Where does all the evilness come?', whereâ€™s all this goodness come from?". We agree with this sentiment, as it seems reasonable to have to take the bad with the good, because it subverts your argument if you pick and choose when to believe in god's power.

3. *Find something from this unit that we learned earlier and compare it to that reading or article or view point. How similar or different are they?*
His story seems similar to that of rabbi Kushner. Both lost their sons but chose to continue their belief in god. The main difference is that Kushner believes in a god of limited power, whereas Liebel seems to believe in a god of complete power but still with a personal connection.
4. *How does this character have a relationship with God? Now find a modern day issue that can be applied to this view or message - how so?*
This character has quite a strong relationship with god, maintained even through his suffering. We think this viewpoint is broad enough to be applied to most issues, as such a strong belief can form a solid basis for weathering any hardships.

5. *What is the overall message of this film in the areas of faith, god, suffering*
The main message of this film seems to be the enduring nature of faith in god through hardship. Though they eventually found god guilty of breaking his covenant with the Jewish people, they still ended up praying to him.
