Mental Health Article Response

1. What is the TAKE AWAY from this story when one discusses mental health and ending one's life? And how is this different than a terminal illness?

I think the main point this article makes is that suicide is never the best choice, and that its consequences far outweigh its benefits. I personally also found the data about how many people are affected by a single suicide to be interesting. With regards to mental health, I think the article's primary argument was that there are effective and positive ways to deal with such issues. The article supports the idea that mental health is significantly different than terminal illness by showing how Hines immediately regretted his decision, showing the momentary ephemerality of mental illness.
