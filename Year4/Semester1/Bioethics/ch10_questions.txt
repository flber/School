Bioethics Ch 10 Notes

- Death is primarily defined as total cessation of brain function.
- It is considered professionally acceptable to stop giving life-supporting aid to "terminally ill" patients (or those in persistent states of vegetation)
- Death is legally important, and as such has been left to the states to be defined.
- The federal government has required (through the patient self-determination act), that any health center make their state's definitions and laws known.
- Living will is a document which tells doctors what sort of end-of-life medical procedures the patient want if they lose the ability to give consent, such as a removal of life support in the event of a vegetative state.
