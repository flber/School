1. What Is The Focus?
The focus is on the research behind the genetic tracing of the White House covid outbreak.

2. Who is the Focus?
The focus is primarily on Trump, as he was clearly the most significant figure to be infected during the outbreak, but the majority of the research is focused on the two reporters who were infected.

3. Where is the Focus?
The White House.

4. When did this happen?
The outbreak occurred several weeks ago, but the research is relatively recent, only being published in the past week.

5. Why or How?
The study was done to lay the foundation for tracing the cause of the White House outbreak, and though it made no guesses as to who began the outbreak, it did build a defensible argument as to the plausibility of such a guess.

Do you think Trump is responsible for the United States' poor handling of the pandemic, and if so, to what extent? In a metaphorical (but quite serious) version of the trolley problem, what do you think his choice was? To what degree is he responsible for the 238,000 deaths in this country?
