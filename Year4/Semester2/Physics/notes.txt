Physics Notes

Momentum:
p = mv
F(net) = Δp / Δt

m_av_a + m_bv_b = m_av'_a + m_bv'_b

Impulse = FΔt

If momentum and energy are conserver, the collision is elastic. If energy is not conserved, the collision is inelastic. 

For elastic collisions:
v_a + v_a' = v_b' + v_b

conversion of horizontal velocity to upward movement
h = v^2 / 2g

Momentum is conserved in two dimensions


Center of mass:

x_cm = (m_1x_1 + m_2x_2) / (m_1 + m_2)


Angular acceleration

α = a/r

Torque

an application of a force to cause something to rotate, distance from point of rotation increases torque

τ = r⊥F

τ = mr^2α

Στ = (Σmr^2)α

Rotational inertia:

I = Σmr^2

(solid cylinder: I = 0.5mr^2)

τ = Iα
