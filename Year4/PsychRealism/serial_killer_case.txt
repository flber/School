Serial Killer Case Study: Jeffrey Dahmer

Respond to the following questions thoughtfully, and with detailed paraphrased references to the text, specifically in Chp 12.

1. What characteristics does Dahmer seem to share with Buffalo Bill, and what about Dahmer's reasoning and motivations may possibly help us understand Buffalo Bill better? (Include the specific TYPE of serial killer Dahmer was. You should know where to find that.)

2. Early on, Dahmer speaks of "depersonalizing a person," of making them an object. Why is this a key and almost necessary trait for serial killers?

3. Is Dahmer an "organized" or "disorganized" serial killer? Make sure to explain why, referencing aspects of the video.

4. He shares the act of cannibalism with Dr. Lecter. In your opinion, is this pretty much all he shares? Is he at all otherwise similar? Why or why not? (Make sure to include specific references to both the character and Dahmer)
