Jahi McMath Questions

1. What were the reasons the doctors felt there was nothing left to do?
The doctors felt there was nothing left to do because there was nothing left to do, Jahi was brain dead.

2. What were her mom and uncle's reasons to keep her alive?
They felt that she could get better and that she should be kept on life support for as long as possible.

3. Which stance do you feel more in agreement with and why?
I definitely agree with the doctors, because brain dead, for all intents and purposes, means dead. Additionally, the mother's referring to Jahi as "still asleep" I feel speaks to some amount of delusion.

4. Can we understand WHY her mom and uncle felt compelled to keep trying? Explain briefly.
I understand why her mum and uncle felt that they should keep trying, as death is often a difficult reality to face.

5. WHO should have the right to decide in this case? Why?
If the family wants to keep their dead child on life support it's their decision, but I personally don't think it's reasonable.
