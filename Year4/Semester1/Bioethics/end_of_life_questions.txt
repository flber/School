End of Life Issues Questions and Video

1. I think a major reason many people find it difficult to talk about end of life issues is because our culture very much rejects and even stigmatizes death, and refuses to acknowledge its presence.

2. I would assume that the issue has grown more complicated recently, as it has only been in modern times when these issues really come up, as previously in human history people didn't live long enough for it to be an issue.

3. I think death with dignity means when someone has the ability to die in a situation which is of their choosing.

4. In general I think that the person who is going to die should have the final say in their own death, but if they are unable to for any reason than close friends or family would probably make more sense.

5. Allowing someone to die seems to mean withdrawing aid which was keeping them alive, and assisting one to die means administering something which will kill them.
