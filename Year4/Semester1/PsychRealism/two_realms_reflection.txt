Two Realms Reflection

In my life I am quite literally caught between two worlds, the consequence of having divorced parents. I have two houses which my brother and I go between, switching every week. For as long as I can remember my mum's house has been the more relaxed house, partly because she (and my stepdad) are less strict, but more so because they trust us to know what the right thing to do is and that trust leads to a feeling of support. But while my dad's house may be less relaxed, my dad is also a bit more willing to listen when I'm talking about various projects I'm working on. Often that difference is simply due to the fact that my dad might be more familiar with what I'm doing, as his job at a tech company means he has often had to deal with some of the things I'm learning, such as RESTful APIs, OAath, or NodeJS. While I don't exactly feel torn between the two houses (though often my mum's house can feel like a break from dad's, and occasionally vice versa), neither one feels complete, if that makes sense. While I'm at my mum's house I feel more at ease, but unable to talk about what I'm interested in, and at my dad's house I more often have someone to talk to about my projects, but I also often feel on-edge. So in some sense constantly moving between the two houses is a good thing, as it allows me to balance out those two deficiencies. While we occasionally go on long trips with one side of the family which upset that balance, I rarely find myself missing the other family members or feeling homesick. I think that's partly due to the fact that I've become accustomed to that seperation.
