Beach sand is poured created a cone whose radius is always equal to twice its height. If the sand is poured at a rate of 20 in^3/sec, how fast is the height changing at the time of the two heights

V = (pi r^2 h)/3
V = (pi (2h)^2 h)/3
dV/dt = d/dt((pi (2h)^2 h)/3)
dV/dt = 4 pi h^2 dh/dt

a. 2 inches
20 in^3/sec = 4 pi (2in)^2 dh/dt
dh/dt = 0.398 in/sec

b. 6 inches
20 in^3/sec = 4 pi (6in)^2 dh/dt
dh/dt = 0.0442 in/sec
