Seminar Questions

1. Toward the end of chapter 31, after Crawford talked to Starling about managing her anger and focusing on catching Buffalo Bill, Starling thinks about how effective Crawford's positive manipulation was even though she knew what he was doing. What do you think is the cause of this persuasion, and why does Starling let herself be persuaded?

2. Dr. Lecter's characterization both forces the reader to admire his intellect and be disturbed by his lack of empathy. Often put next to characters who are somehow even more unlikeable than himself, such as Dr. Chilton in chapter 27, the author frequently seems to be making Lecter out to be the lesser of many evils. Why do you think this is, and what do you think it shows about society's interest in the disturbing world that these characters live in?
