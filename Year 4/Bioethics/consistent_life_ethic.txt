Consistent Life Ethic

-- Quotes

"The spectrum of life cuts across the issues of genetics, abortion, capital punishment, modern warfare and the care of the terminally ill"

"When human life is considered 'cheap' or easily expendable in one area, eventually nothing is held as sacred and all lives are in jeopardy"

"it would be contradictory, for example, to be against abortion but for capital punishment or to work against poverty but support euthanasia"

"Capital punishment, racism, poverty: certainly these are very different issues, with different causes and different solutions"

"For example, we may be opposed to euthanasia and assisted suicide fundamentally because of our faith convictions about God as giver of the gift of life and about our own stewardship of life. For public policy discussion, however, we may stress other reasons, such as human dignity, the undermining of trust in the medical profession, the threat to women and the vulnerable."

-- Summary

The consistent life ethic, as applied to the issue of abortion, says that all life is sacred and equal, and as such shouldn't be destroyed. Additionally, the article compares abortion and capital punishment, which is, in my mind, an odd comparison. While I actually don't think that capital punishment is a good idea, that opinion stems from data which show that the death penalty actually doesn't prevent people from commiting those crimes, and so is sort of pointless. But for me the comparison really doesn't make sense, because it's two totally seperate situations. Additionally, my personal views go the other direction: I don't think any life has intrinsic value. However, I (unlike the article) don't think that it really matters in most situations. I think that every situation requires some amount of debate, and that to simply use a blanket definition one way or the other ignores those subtleties
