# Des Cartes

## General Info
Name: Des Cartes
Dates: 1596 - 1650
Background: Rationalist Philosopher

## Main Points
Four steps to certainty of truth:
- accept only that which is clearly apparent
- break down problems into component parts to find solution
- begin with simplest matters and work way up to more complex questions
- keep records of discoveries
"I think, therefore I am": most basic and immutable truth

## Influence
He laid the basis of rationalist philosophy, and his famous statement "I think, therefore I am" is still a well known phrase to this fay.

## Major Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths
- Very simple arguments are almost inarguable
- Basic truths are easy to understand and explain

Weaknesses
- Arguments are almost so simple as to be irrelevant
- His extremely rational approach essentially discounts most of our observable world

## Question
I would ask "What is the balance between absolute truth (I think, therefore I am) and that which is true enough?"

## Modern Implementation
Des Carte's four steps to find truth are useful for far more than philosophy, and I use a similar process to debug software issues. The practice of breaking down a problem into its component parts is especially useful.
