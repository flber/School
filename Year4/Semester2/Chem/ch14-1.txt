26. The following are representations of acid-base reactions:

HF + H₂O <=> H₃O⁺ + F⁻
NH₃ + HCl <=> NH₄⁺ + Cl⁻

a. label each of the species in both equations as an acid or a base and explain your answers

acids: HF, HCl; both are proton donors
bases: H₂O, NH₃; both are proton acceptors

b. for those species that are acids, which labels apply: Arrhenius acid, Brønsted-Lowry acid, Lewis acid? What about the bases?

HF and HCl are both Arrhenius and Brønsted-Lowry acids. H₂O and NH₃ are both Brønsted-Lowry bases.


36. Write the dissociation reaction and the corresponding K_a equilibrium expression for each of the following acids in water.

a. HCN
HCN + H₂O <=> CN⁻ + H₃O⁺
K_a = 6.2 x 10^-10

b. HOC₆H₅
HOC₆H₅ + H₂O <=> OC₆H₅⁻ + H₃O⁺
K_a = 1.6 x 10^-10

c. C₆H₅NH₃⁺
C₆H₅NH₃⁺ + H₂O <=> C₆H₅NH₂ + H₃O⁺


40. Consider the following illustrations:

[strong acid] [weak acid]

a. HNO₂: weak acid

b. HNO₃: strong acid

c. HCl: strong acid

d. HF: strong acid

e. HC₂H₃O₂: weak acid


41. Use table 14.2 to order the following from the strongest to the weakest acid.

HClO₂, H₂O, NH₄⁺, HClO₄
HClO₂ > H₂O > HClO₄ > NH₄⁺
