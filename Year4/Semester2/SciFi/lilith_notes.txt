Notes on the History of Lilith

1. In Gilgamesh: Lilith is a villain who is defeated and forced to flee into the desert, also a plaque showing her as naked woman with bird wings, taloned feet, and horns.

2. Isaiah 34: describes a chaotic, desert land where the "lilith shal repose", connecting back to early Gilgamesh story.

3. Dead Sea Scrolls: appears in hymn along with spirits, demons, and destroying angels.

4. Talmud: brings back older Babylonian characteristics as a succubus, mainly embodies the demon-lover myth.

5. The Alphabet of Ben Sira: Lilith as destructive, capable of flight, succubus, but also as Adam's first wife. Tells of fight with Adam for equality, ends up leaving Eden by speaking god's name, and goes to the Red Sea (however, this story may be satire)

6. Zohar: Lilith as temptress of men, breeder of evil spirits, and carrier of disease (also gives god a female side). Partners her with the male personification of evil, essentially satan.

7. Narnia: the white witch is somewhat in Lilith's image?!

8. Goldberg: similar to The Alphabet, Lilith refuses subservience and flees Eden, later comes back and meets Eve, whereupon the become friends.

9. Hadas' poem: from the perspective of Lilith, casts her and Adam as opposites who can't understand each other. Refused by god and Adam, she ends up traveling the world alone.


Thematic Significance
Lilith's various incarnations over time can represent the evolving view of the role of females in society, from an evil seductress to a model of independence. Butler may have named the protagonist Lilith to hint at a conflict between the true nature of the character and society's view of her.
