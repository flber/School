## To Cat
We've had some rough times over the past few months, and I think it's time to go our separate ways. I've realized that while we've tried to fix things, there are just too many underlying issues between us. We have different expectations of relationships and conversations, which we've tried to fix, but we also have different values, ideals, and personalities, which I don't think can, or should, be fixed. We're each individual people, and I think at the end of the day who we are just doesn't work together. We've both been willing to overlook this for a while, but I don't think it's healthy to continue to ignore our differences or try to change them. I've also realized that it's not fair for me to keep trying to make this work when you could be finding someone who can give you as much as you give them. 

## To Rachel
I just broke up with Cat, so I wanted to say goodbye and convey my gratitude for your kindness. I felt that our relationship was no longer healthy, and that it would be better for both of us to no longer be together. With that said, thank you for all of your hospitality and warmth; I always appreciated how much you included me in your home. 
Unfortunately, this message is also to ask something of you. I'm worried about how Cat will handle this, and I just wanted to ask you to make sure she's at least safe. While she hasn't hurt herself in a long time, I'm concerned that she may go back to old habits. I know that you're aware of this, and undoubtedly also worried, but I just wanted to ask you to make sure she's safe.

Thank you
Ben
