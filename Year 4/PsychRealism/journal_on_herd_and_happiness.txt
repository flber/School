Journal on the Herd and Happiness

1. In Chapter 7, where do you see connections between Sinclair and Nietzche's philosophy on love and happiness?

Sinclair is quite clearly influenced by Nietzche's philosophy on love, as is evident by his frequent expression of the sentiment that happiness, and, by extension, love, can only exist when one is at peace with and connected to a sense of their own fate. This mirrors Nietzche's own idea of amor fatis, that one should, at times, have a sense of respect and love for their past and their fate. While Sinclair expresses this idea more often through the love of a personification of 
his own fate, the sentiment remains the same. Because of this difference I view Sinclair's ideas as variations on Nietzche's philosphies instead of direct copies, but they are certainly very similar.

2. In your own opinion, what things or experiences are required in one's life for them to feel true happiness? (Material, philosophical, emotional, etc.)

My immediate thinking has always been that for the majority of people, the most important thing in life to achieve a true feeling of happiness is a sense of purpose. While things like money or fame might help achieve superficial happiness, I think that the idea that you have something which is your purpose is far more appealing in the long term. Unfortunately for me my thinking has always been that no one really has any innate purpose, so that path towards happiness hasn't ever worked for me. I've never really found a good subsitute for that sense of purpose, so I'm not sure where that leaves me.
