Chapter 11.1 # 9, 11, 16, 19, 21, 24

9. Figure 11–51 shows two examples of SHM, labeled A and B. For each, what is (a) the amplitude, (b) the frequency, and (c) the period?

a. A: 2.5, B: 3.5
b. A: 0.5 Hz, B: 0.25 Hz
c. A: 3 s, B: 2 s


11. At what displacement of an SHO is the energy half kinetic and half potential?

16. It takes a force of 91.0 N to compress the spring of a toy popgun 0.175 m to “load” a 0.160-kg ball. With what speed will the ball leave the gun if fired horizontally?

19. A mass resting on a horizontal, frictionless surface is attached to one end of a spring; the other end is fixed to a wall. It takes 3.6 J of work to compress the spring by 0.13 m. If the spring is compressed, and the mass is released from rest, it experiences a maximum acceleration of 12 m/s^2. Find the value of (a) the spring constant and (b) the mass.

21. At t = 0, an 885-g mass at rest on the end of a horizontal spring (k = 184 N/m) is struck by a hammer which gives it an initial speed of 2.26 m/s. Determine (a) the period and frequency of the motion, (b) the amplitude,(c) the maximum acceleration, (d) the total energy, and (e) the kinetic energy when x = 0.40A where A is the amplitude.

24. A block of mass m is supported by two identical parallel vertical springs, each with spring stiffness constant k. What will be the frequency of vertical oscillation?
