-- Solidarity:
  "understanding the interconnections that exist between oppression and privilege, between the rich and the poor, the oppressed and the oppressors"

-- Mutuality:
  "implements the theory of solidarity at the same time that it provides the ground for the reflection needed to elaborate further the theory of solidarity"


-- Are the poor better than us? more moral or holy? WHY must we listen to be in solidarity with them?
  "The poor are not better or more moral or holy than us, but we must listen to them to be in solidarity with them because as Diaz says: 'This contribution which they alone can give makes it possible for everyone to overcome alienation'"
