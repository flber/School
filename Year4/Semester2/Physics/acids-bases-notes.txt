Acids and Bases Videos Notes

amphiprotic: functions as both acid and base
	- water
	- bicarbonate

pH = -log[H₃O⁺]
pOH = -log[OH⁻]

autoionization of water: H₂O + H₂O <=> H₃O⁺ + OH⁻
	- very low k
	- k_w = 1.0 x 10^-14 at 25°C
	- lower temp: higher pK_w
	- higher temp: lower pK_w

strong acids:
	- HCl
	- Hbr
	- HI
	- HNO₃
	- H₂SO₄
	- HClO₃
	- HClO₄

k_w = [H₃O⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 x 10^-14 at 25°C
