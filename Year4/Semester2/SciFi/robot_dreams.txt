Robot Dreams

1. What type of scientist is Linda Rash? Why do you think this profession exists in the future? Ultimately, what does she reveal about the robots and how? 
Dr. Rash is a robot psychologist, which seems to be necessary as robots become more complex. She reveals that there is a possibility that the positronic brains can slowly become conscious.

2. Whatâ€™s interesting about the characterization of Susan Calvin on p. 92? Greater meaning?
She's frequently referred to using titles, and almost seems to be robotic, certainly incredibly intelligent.

3. What questions does this story raise about humanity?
A main question is can we create humanity, as well as how can you identify such consciousness if we were to create it. The themes of freedom in the robots dream also call into question our control and ownership over such beings.

4. What questions does this story raise about robotics and/or machine intelligence? 
How close can a robot get to being a person before it is a person, whether or not a computer can be more human than us (either by intelligence or consciousness)

5. In the story, what role(s) do robots assume in society? How is this similar to/different from the role they assume now? What are your own predictions about their future uses?
In this story robots serve as general laborers, as well as research subjects. They seem to mostly be far more capable than the robots we have, and it seems that the robots in the story could be representative of robots in our future (especially looking at Boston Dynamics' work)
